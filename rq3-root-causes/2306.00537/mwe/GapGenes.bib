  abstract = {We study by Green's Function Reaction Dynamics the effect of the diffusive
	motion of repressor molecules on the noise in {mRNA} and protein
	levels for a gene that is under the control of a repressor. We find
	that spatial fluctuations due to diffusion can drastically enhance
	the noise in gene expression. After dissociation from the operator,
	a repressor can rapidly rebind to the {DNA.} Our results show that
	the rebinding trajectories are so short that, on this timescale,
	the {RNA} polymerase {(RNAP)} cannot effectively compete with the
	repressor for binding to the promoter. As a result, a dissociated
	repressor molecule will on average rebind many times, before it eventually
	diffuses away. These rebindings thus lower the effective dissociation
	rate, and this increases the noise in gene expression. Another consequence
	of the timescale separation between repressor rebinding and {RNAP}
	association is that the effect of spatial fluctuations can be described
	by a well-stirred, zero-dimensional, model by renormalizing the reaction
	rates for {repressor-DNA} (un) binding. Our results thus support
	the use of well-stirred, zero-dimensional models for describing noise
	in gene expression. We also show that for a fixed repressor strength,
	the noise due to diffusion can be minimized by increasing the number
	of repressors or by decreasing the rate of the open complex formation.
	Lastly, our results emphasize that power spectra are a highly useful
	tool for studying the propagation of noise through the different
	stages of gene expression.},

	these ideas. Here, the question of Bcd mobility was investigated
	using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy in live Drosophila melanogaster

	cytoplasm during cycles 12-14, with a diffusion coefficient {\textasciitilde}7

	of the Bcd gradient simply by diffusion before cycle 8, i.e., before

  abstract = {The functions of most genetic circuits require a sufficient degree
	of cooperativity in the circuit components. Although mechanisms of
	cooperativity have been studied most extensively in the context of
	transcriptional initiation control, cooperativity from other processes
	involved in the operation of the circuits can also play important
	roles. In this work, we examine a simple kinetic source of cooperativity
	stemming from the nonlinear degradation of multimeric proteins. Ample
	experimental evidence suggests that protein subunits can degrade
	less rapidly when associated in multimeric complexes, an effect we
	refer to as âcooperative stability.â For dimeric transcription factors,
	this effect leads to a concentration-dependence in the degradation
	rate because monomers, which are predominant at low concentrations,
	will be more rapidly degraded. Thus, cooperative stability can effectively
	widen the accessible range of protein levels in vivo. Through theoretical
	analysis of two exemplary genetic circuits in bacteria, we show that
	such an increased range is important for the robust operation of
	genetic circuits as well as their evolvability. Our calculations
	demonstrate that a few-fold difference between the degradation rate
	of monomers and dimers can already enhance the function of these
	circuits substantially. We discuss molecular mechanisms of cooperative
	stability and their occurrence in natural or engineered systems.
	Our results suggest that cooperative stability needs to be considered
	explicitly and characterized quantitatively in any systematic experimental
	or theoretical study of gene circuits.},

	another's synthesis. Qualitative reasoning suggests that such a system
	will have two stable states, one in which the first element is "on"
	and the second "off", and another in which these states are reversed.
	Quantitative analysis shows that the existence of two stable steady
	states depends on the details of the system. Among other things,
	the shapes of functions describing the effect of one regulatory element
	on the other must meet certain criteria in order for two steady states
	to exist. Many biologically reasonable functions do not meet these
	criteria. In particular, repression that is well described by a {Michaelis-Menten-type}
	equation cannot lead to a working switch. However, functions describing
	positive cooperativity of binding, non-additive effects of multiple

  month = may,
  abstract = {An important feature of development is the formation of patterns that
	are proportional to the overall size of the embryo. But how such
	proportionality, or scaling, is achieved mechanistically remains
	poorly understood. Furthermore, it is currently unclear whether organisms
	utilize similar or distinct mechanisms to achieve scaling within
	a species and between species. Here we investigate within-species
	scaling mechanisms for anterior-posterior {(A-P)} patterning in Drosophila
	melanogaster, focusing specifically on the properties of the Bicoid
	{(Bcd)} morphogen gradient. Using embryos from lines artificially
	selected for large and small egg volume, we show that large embryos
	have higher nuclear Bcd concentrations in the anterior than small
	embryos. This anterior difference leads to scaling properties of
	the Bcd gradient profiles: in broad regions of the large and small
	embryos along the {A-P} axis, normalizing their positions to embryo
	length reduces the differences in both the nuclear Bcd concentrations
	and Bcd-encoded positional information. We further trace the origin
	of Bcd gradient scaling by showing directly that large embryos have
	more maternally deposited bcd {mRNA} than small embryos. Our results
	suggest a simple model for how within-species Bcd gradient scaling
	can be achieved. In this model, the Bcd production rate, which is
	dependent on the total number of bcd {mRNA} molecules in the anterior,
	is scaled with embryo volume.},

  abstract = {Summary Background: The activity of the Bicoid {(Bcd)} transcription
	factor is a useful example of how quantitative information contained
	in a smooth morphogen gradient is transformed into discrete and precise
	patterns of target gene expression. There are two distinct and important
	aspects to this process: the "sharpening" of the posterior borders
	of the expression domains and the "precision" of where the target
	genes are expressed along the length of the embryo as the syncytial
	embryo begins to cellularize. Although the sharpening phenomenon
	was observed over a decade ago, it is still poorly understood. Results:
	Here, we show that a Bcd reporter gene containing binding sites only
	for Bcd is expressed, like natural targets of Bcd, in a precise domain
	with a sharp boundary. Analysis of embryos expressing deleted forms
	of Bcd indicates that the sharpness of the Bcd target gene hunchback's
	expression involves the glutamine-rich and C-terminal activation
	domains of Bcd. Furthermore, several artificial Gal4-derived transcription
	factors expressed as gradients in the embryo share Bcd's ability
	to drive precise target gene expression with sharp boundaries. Conclusion:
	Thus, contrary to recent reports proposing that the Bcd gradient
	is not sufficient to establish precise positional information, we
	show that Bcd drives precise and sharp expression of its target genes
	through a process that depends exclusively on its ability to activate
	transcription. },

	levels of multiple genes come to be correlated with position, and

	We show how to measure this information, in bits, using the gap genes
	in the Drosophila embryo as an example. Individual genes carry nearly
	two bits of information, twice as much as expected if the expression
	patterns consisted only of on/off domains separated by sharp boundaries.
	Taken together, four gap genes carry enough information to define
	a cell's location with an error bar of {\textasciitilde}1\% along
	the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo. This precision is nearly
	enough for each cell to have a unique identity, which is the maximum
	information the system can use, and is nearly constant along the
	length of the embryo. We argue that this constancy is a signature
	of optimality in the transmission of information from primary morphogen
	inputs to the output of the gap gene network.},

  abstract = {Using differential interference contrast optics, combined with cinematography,
	we have studied the morphological changes that the living, syncytial
	embryo undergoes from stage 10 through 14 of Drosophila embryogenesis,
	that is just prior to and during formation of the cellular blastoderm.
	We have supplemented these studies with data collected from fixed,
	stained, whole embryos. The following information has been obtained.
	The average duration of nuclear cycles 10, 11, 12 and 13 is about
	9, 10, 12 and 21 min, respectively (25 degrees C). In these four
	cycles, the duration of that portion of the mitotic period that lacks
	a discrete nuclear envelope is 3, 3, 3 and 5 min, respectively. The
	length of nuclear cycle 14 varies in a position-specific manner throughout
	the embryo, the shortest cycles being of 65 min duration. During
	nuclear cycles 10 through 13, it is commonly observed in living embryos
	that the syncytial blastoderm nuclei enter (and leave) mitosis in
	one of two waves that originate nearly simultaneously from the opposite
	anterior and posterior poles of the embryo, and terminate in its
	midregion. From our preparations of quick-frozen embryos, we estimate
	that these mitotic waves take on average about half a minute to travel
	over the embryonic surface from pole to equator. The yolk nuclei,
	which remain in the core of the embryo when the rest of the nuclei
	migrate to the periphery, divide in synchrony with the migrating
	nuclei at nuclear cycles 8 and 9, and just after the now peripherally
	located nuclei at nuclear cycle 10. After cycle 10, these yolk nuclei
	cease dividing and become polyploid. The syncytial embryo has at
	least three distinct levels of cytoskeletal organization: structured
	domains of cytoplasm are organized around each blastoderm nucleus;
	radially directed tracks orient colchicine-sensitive saltatory transport
	throughout the peripheral cytoplasm; and a long-range organization
	of the core of the embryo makes possible coherent movements of the
	large inner yolk mass in concert with each nuclear cycle. This highly
	organized cytoplasm may be involved in providing positional information
	for the important process of nuclear determination that is known
	to occur during these stages.},

  abstract = {Summary A remarkable feature of development is its reproducibility,
	the ability to correct embryo-to-embryo variations and instruct precise
	patterning. In Drosophila, embryonic patterning along the anterior-posterior
	axis is controlled by the morphogen gradient Bicoid {(Bcd).} In this
	article, we describe quantitative studies of the native Bcd gradient
	and its target Hunchback {(Hb).} We show that the native Bcd gradient
	is highly reproducible and is itself scaled with embryo length. While
	a precise Bcd gradient is necessary for precise Hb expression, it
	still has positional errors greater than Hb expression. We describe
	analyses further probing mechanisms for Bcd gradient scaling and
	correction of its residual positional errors. Our results suggest
	a simple model of a robust Bcd gradient sufficient to achieve scaled
	and precise activation of its targets. The robustness of this gradient
	is conferred by its intrinsic properties of "self-correcting" the
	inevitable input variations to achieve a precise and reproducible
	output.},

	early Drosophila embryos. Although the form of the Bicoid profile
	is consistent with a simple diffusion/degradation model, the observed
	length scale is much larger than should be expected based on the
	measured diffusion rate. Here, we study two possible mechanisms that
	could, in principle, affect this gradient and, hence, address this
	disagreement. First, we show that including trapping and release
	of Bicoid by the nuclei during cleavage cycles does not alter the
	morphogen length scale. More crucially, the inclusion of advective
	transport due to cytoplasmic streaming can have a large effect. Specifically,
	we build a simple model based on the (limited) experimental data
	and show that such a flow can lead to a Bicoid profile that is consistent
	with various experimental features. Specifically, the observed length
	scale is obtained, a steady profile is established, and improved
	scaling between embryos of different lengths is demonstrated.},

	But in developing embryos, cells within a tissue must overcome such
	variability in order to provide the uniformity required to coordinate
	multiple events. Reproducibility and determinacy of the spatial protein
	patterns preceding tissue differentiation is a critical aspect of
	development. In this study, we use anterior-posterior {(AP)} segmentation

	dynamics control noise. One of the earliest {AP} patterning events
	is the anterior activation of the hunchback (hb) gene by the maternally-derived

	characterized, providing the tools for us to develop a stochastic
	model of hb gene regulation to make predictions about expression
	noise, and to corroborate these experimentally. For hb, we show that
	self-regulation is a critical part of controlling noise, and the
	multiple Bcd binding sites in the hb promoter also enhance pattern
	reproducibility. To the degree that such features are shared by other

	The method features a weighted ensemble of trajectories in configuration
	space with energy levels dictating the proper correspondence between
	"particles" and probability. Instead of waiting a very long time
	for an unlikely event to occur, the probability packets are split,
	and small packets of probability are allowed to diffuse almost immediately
	into regions of configuration space that are less likely to be sampled.
	The method has been applied to the Northrup and Erickson (1992) model
	of docking-type diffusion-limited reactions and yields reaction rate
	constants in agreement with those obtained by direct Brownian simulation,
	but at a fraction of the CPU time (10(-4) to 10(-3), depending on
	the model). Because the method is essentially a variant of standard
	Brownian dynamics algorithms, it is anticipated that weighted-ensemble
	Brownian dynamics, in conjunction with biophysical force models,
	can be applied to a large class of association reactions of interest
	to the biophysics community.},

  abstract = {Despite recent advances in experimental approaches for identifying
	transcriptional cis-regulatory modules {(CRMs,} âenhancersâ), direct
	empirical discovery of {CRMs} for all genes in all cell types and
	environmental conditions is likely to remain an elusive goal. Effective
	methods for computational {CRM} discovery are thus a critically needed
	complement to empirical approaches. However, existing computational
	methods that search for clusters of putative binding sites are ineffective
	if the relevant {TFs} and/or their binding specificities are unknown.
	Here, we provide a significantly improved method for âmotif-blindâ
	{CRM} discovery that does not depend on knowledge or accurate prediction
	of {TF-binding} motifs and is effective when limited knowledge of
	functional {CRMs} is available to âsuperviseâ the search. We propose
	a new statistical method, based on {âInterpolated} Markov Modelsâ,
	for motif-blind, genome-wide {CRM} discovery. It captures the statistical
	profile of variable length words in known {CRMs} of a regulatory
	network and finds candidate {CRMs} that match this profile. The method
	also uses orthologs of the known {CRMs} from closely related genomes.
	We perform in silico evaluation of predicted {CRMs} by assessing
	whether their neighboring genes are enriched for the expected expression
	patterns. This assessment uses a novel statistical test that extends
	the widely used Hypergeometric test of gene set enrichment to account
	for variability in intergenic lengths. We find that the new {CRM}
	prediction method is superior to existing methods. Finally, we experimentally
	validate 12 new {CRM} predictions by examining their regulatory activity
	in vivo in Drosophila; 10 of the tested {CRMs} were found to be functional,
	while 6 of the top 7 predictions showed the expected activity patterns.
	We make our program available as downloadable source code, and as
	a plugin for a genome browser installed on our servers.},

	gene giant is a bona fide gap gene that is likely to act in concert
	with hunchback, Kruppel and knirps to initiate stripes of gene expression.
	We show that Kruppel and giant are expressed in complementary, non-overlapping
	sets of cells in the early embryo. These complementary patterns depend
	on mutually repressive interactions between the two genes. Ectopic
	expression of giant in early embryos results in the selective repression
	of Kruppel, and advanced-stage embryos show cuticular defects similar
	to those observed in Kruppel- mutants. This result and others suggest
	that the strongest regulatory interactions occur among those gap
	genes expressed in nonadjacent domains. We propose that the precisely
	balanced overlapping gradients of gap gene expression depend on these
	strong regulatory interactions, coupled with weak interactions between
	neighboring genes.},

  abstract = {Bicoid {(Bcd)} is the anterior determinant in Drosophila. Accordingly,
	loss of Bcd causes loss of head and thorax and their replacement
	with posterior structures. bcd {mRNA} is maternally deposited at
	the anterior pole and Bcd forms an anterior-to-posterior {(AP)} concentration
	gradient. The expression of a series of zygotic head genes is thought
	to be differentially regulated by distinct threshold concentrations
	of the Bcd gradient. Thereby Bcd functions as a morphogen, instructing
	fields of cells to take on specific fates. Here, we show that spatial
	limits of anterior genes are also set in the absence of a Bcd gradient
	and depend on factors of the maternal terminal system. The receptor
	tyrosine kinase Torso {(Tor),} a key component of this system, is
	active in the pole regions of the embryo. Its activity downregulates
	the maternally deposited repressor Capicua {(Cic),} leaving high
	Cic activity in the central regions and decreasingly lower Cic activities
	toward the poles. We show that the positions of posterior boundaries
	of Bcd target genes are dependent not only on Bcd, but also on Tor-mediated
	Cic activity. The results indicate that Cic can mediate repression
	through distinct binding sites within a Bcd responsive enhancer and
	that gene activation by Bcd is antagonized by Cic. The activating
	and repressive effects of Bcd and Cic, respectively, are integrated
	by the Bcd target gene enhancer. We conclude that the spatial domains
	of head gene expression are determined by Bcd in concert with Tor-dependent
	repressors.},

  abstract = {Developing embryos exhibit a robust capability to reduce phenotypic
	variations that occur naturally or as a result of experimental manipulation.
	This reduction in variation occurs by an epigenetic mechanism called
	canalization, a phenomenon which has resisted understanding because
	of a lack of necessary molecular data and of appropriate gene regulation
	models. In recent years, quantitative gene expression data have become
	available for the segment determination process in the Drosophila
	blastoderm, revealing a specific instance of canalization. These
	data show that the variation of the zygotic segmentation gene expression
	patterns is markedly reduced compared to earlier levels by the time
	gastrulation begins, and this variation is significantly lower than
	the variation of the maternal protein gradient Bicoid. We used a
	predictive dynamical model of gene regulation to study the effect
	of Bicoid variation on the downstream gap genes. The model correctly
	predicts the reduced variation of the gap gene expression patterns
	and allows the characterization of the canalizing mechanism. We show
	that the canalization is the result of specific regulatory interactions
	among the zygotic gap genes. We demonstrate the validity of this
	explanation by showing that variation is increased in embryos mutant
	for two gap genes, Kruppel and knirps, disproving competing proposals
	that canalization is due to an undiscovered morphogen, or that it
	does not take place at all. In an accompanying article in {PLoS}
	Comput Biol (doi:10.1371/journal:pcbi.1000303), we show that cross
	regulation between the gap genes causes their expression to approach
	dynamical attractors, reducing initial variation and providing a
	robust output. These results demonstrate that the Bicoid gradient
	is not sufficient to produce gap gene borders having the low variance
	observed, and instead this low variance is generated by gap gene
	cross regulation. More generally, we show that the complex multigenic
	phenomenon of canalization can be understood at a quantitative and
	predictive level by the application of a precise dynamical model.},

	This biologically essential process is an example of the phenomenon
	known as canalization. It has been suggested that the developmental
	trajectory of a wild-type organism is inherently stable, and that
	canalization is a manifestation of this property. Although the role
	of gap genes in the canalization process was established by correctly
	predicting the response of the system to particular perturbations,
	the stability of the developmental trajectory remains to be investigated.
	For many years, it has been speculated that stability against perturbations
	during development can be described by dynamical systems having attracting
	sets that drive reductions of volume in phase space. In this paper,
	we show that both the reduction in variability of gap gene expression
	as well as shifts in the position of posterior gap gene domains are
	the result of the actions of attractors in the gap gene dynamical
	system. Two biologically distinct dynamical regions exist in the
	early embryo, separated by a bifurcation at 53\% egg length. In the
	anterior region, reduction in variation occurs because of stability
	induced by point attractors, while in the posterior, the stability
	of the developmental trajectory arises from a one-dimensional attracting
	manifold. This manifold also controls a previously characterized
	anterior shift of posterior region gap domains. Our analysis shows
	that the complex phenomena of canalization and pattern formation
	in the Drosophila blastoderm can be understood in terms of the qualitative

  abstract = {Normal development of multicellular organisms requires cells to respond
	properly according to their positions. Positional information is
	often provided to cells as concentrations of diffusive chemicals
	called morphogens with spatial gradients. However, the spatial profiles
	of their concentrations include various kinds of noises, making positional
	information unreliable. In many developmental systems, multiple morphogen
	gradients are adopted to specify the spatial position along a single
	axis, presumably to achieve a sufficiently high precision of information
	on the location of each cell. In this paper, we ask how the precision
	of positional information depends on the number of morphogens. We
	derive a formula for the limit of precision when each cell adopts
	the maximum-likelihood estimation of the âtrueâ position from noisy
	inputs. The precision increases with the number of morphogens and
	interestingly it also depends on the correlation of noises. The positional
	specification can be made more precisely if their gradients are of
	the opposite (same) direction when noises of the two morphogens are
	positively (negatively) correlated. The formula also tells us a minimum
	number of morphogens needed to achieve a given precision of positional
	information. We illustrate the theory by analyzing experimental data
	for the gradients of two diffusive chemicals, Bicoid and Caudal,
	in the early development of Drosophila embryo. The analysis suggests
	that combined information provided by the two chemicals is able to
	give accurate positional information in the middle part of the embryo,

	the Drosophila embryo. Bcd is required for the activation of a series
	of target genes, which are expressed at specific positions within
	the gradient. Here we directly tested whether different concentration
	thresholds within the Bcd gradient establish the relative positions
	of its target genes by flattening the gradient and systematically
	varying expression levels. Genome-wide expression profiles were used
	to estimate the total number of Bcd target genes, and a general correlation
	was found between the Bcd concentration required for activation and
	the positions where target genes are expressed in wild-type embryos.
	However, concentrations required for target gene activation in embryos
	with flattened Bcd were consistently lower than those present at
	each target gene's position in the wild-type gradient, suggesting
	that Bcd is in excess at every position along the {AP} axis. Also,
	several Bcd target genes were positioned in correctly ordered stripes
	in embryos with flattened Bcd, and we suggest that these stripes
	are normally regulated by interactions between Bcd and the terminal
	patterning system. Our findings argue strongly against the strict
	interpretation of the Bcd morphogen hypothesis, and support the idea
	that target gene positioning involves combinatorial interactions
	that are mediated by the binding site architecture of each gene's
	cis-regulatory elements.},

	to initiate expression of a target gene, hunchback, in nuclei at

	boundary of the product protein Hunchback at around 49\% embryo length.
	Remarkably, the embryo-embryo variability in the boundary position
	is less than 5\%. Reactions in embryos, however, should be intrinsically
	noisy because the number of molecules involved is small, and those
	reactions are governed by randomly diffusing molecules. The mechanisms
	to generate the invariable Hunchback distribution by filtering the

  abstract = {It is widely accepted that morphogenetic gradients determine cell

	precise is each step in the gene expression process that acts downstream
	of morphogens, however, remains unclear. The Bicoid morphogen is
	a transcription factor directly activating its target genes and provides
	thus a simple system to address this issue in a quantitative manner.
	Recent studies indicate that the Bicoid gradient is precisely established
	in Drosophila embryos after eight nuclear divisions (cycle 9) and
	that target protein expression is specified five divisions later
	(cycle 14), with a precision that corresponds to a relative difference
	of Bicoid concentration of 10\%. To understand how such precision
	was achieved, we directly analyzed nascent transcripts of the hunchback
	target gene at their site of synthesis. Most anterior nuclei in cycle
	11 interphasic embryos exhibit efficient biallelic transcription
	of hunchback and this synchronous expression is specified within
	a 10\% difference of Bicoid concentration. The fast diffusion of
	{Bcd-EGFP} (7.7 Î¼m2/s) that we captured by fluorescent correlation
	spectroscopy in the nucleus is consistent with this robust expression
	at cycle 11. However, given the interruption of transcription during
	mitosis, it remains too slow to be consistent with precise de novo
	reading of Bicoid concentration at each interphase, suggesting the
	existence of a memorization process that recalls this information
	from earlier cycles. The two anterior maternal morphogens, Bicoid
	and Hunchback, contribute differently to this early response: whereas
	Bicoid provides dose-dependent positional information along the axis,
	maternal Hunchback is required for the synchrony of the response
	and is therefore likely to be involved in this memorization process.},

	localized source of Bcd at the anterior pole. However, we previously
	published evidence that the Bcd gradient is preceded by a bcd {mRNA}
	gradient. Here, we have revisited and extended this observation by
	showing that the bcd {mRNA} and Bcd protein gradient profiles are
	virtually identical at all times. This confirms our previous conclusion
	that the Bcd gradient is produced by a bcd {mRNA} gradient rather
	than by diffusion. Based on our observation that bcd {mRNA} colocalizes
	with Staufen {(Stau),} we propose that the bcd {mRNA} gradient forms
	by a novel mechanism involving quasi-random active transport of a
	Stau-bcd {mRNA} complex through a nonpolar microtubular network,
	which confines the bcd {mRNA} to the cortex of the embryo.},

	control the segmentation morphogenetic field of Drosophila at the
	protein level in one dimension. The data used for this characterization
	are quantitative with cellular resolution in space and about 6 min
	in time. We present the full quantitative profiles of all 14 segmentation
	genes which act before the onset of gastrulation. The expression
	patterns of these genes are first characterized in terms of their
	average or typical behavior. At this level, the expression of all
	of the genes has been integrated into a single atlas of gene expression
	in which the expression levels of all genes in each cell are specified.
	We show that expression domains do not arise synchronously, but rather
	each domain has its own specific dynamics of formation. Moreover,
	we show that the expression domains shift position in the direction
	of the cephalic furrow, such that domains in the anlage of the segmented
	germ band shift anteriorly while those in the presumptive head shift
	posteriorly. The expression atlas of integrated data is very close
	to the expression profiles of individual embryos during the latter
	part of the blastoderm stage. At earlier times gap gene domains show
	considerable variation in amplitude, and significant positional variability.
	Nevertheless, an average early gap domain is close to that of a median
	individual. In contrast, we show that there is a diversity of developmental
	trajectories among pair-rule genes at a variety of levels, including
	the order of domain formation and positional accuracy. We further
	show that this variation is dynamically reduced, or canalized, over
	time. As the first quantitatively characterized morphogenetic field,
	this system and its behavior constitute an extraordinarily rich set
	of materials for the study of canalization and embryonic regulation

	a logical model accounting for the ability of the pair-rule module
	to determine the formation of alternate juxtaposed Engrailed- and
	Wingless-expressing cells that form the (para)segmental boundaries.
	This module has the intrinsic capacity to generate four distinct
	expression states, each characterized by the expression of a particular
	combination of pair-rule genes or expression mode. The selection
	of one of these expression modes depends on the maternal and gap
	inputs, but also crucially on cross-regulations among pair-rule genes.
	The latter are instrumental in the interpretation of the maternal-gap
	pre-pattern. Our logical model allows the qualitative reproduction
	of the patterns of pair-rule gene expressions corresponding to the
	wild type situation, to loss-of-function and cis-regulatory mutations,
	and to ectopic pair-rule expressions. Furthermore, this model provides
	a formal explanation for the morphogenetic role of the initial bell-shaped
	expression of the gene even-skipped, i.e. for the distinct effects
	of different levels of the Even-skipped protein on its target pair-rule
	genes. It also accounts for the requirement of Even-skipped for the
	formation of all Engrailed-stripes. Finally, it provides new insights

	By switching on a signal only where the local concentration is above

  abstract = {The problem of pattern is considered in terms of how genetic information
	can be translated in a reliable manner to give specific and different
	spatial patterns of cellular differentiation. Pattern formation thus
	differs from molecular differentiation which is mainly concerned
	with the control of synthesis of specific macromolecules within cells
	rather than the spatial arrangement of the cells. It is suggested
	that there may be a universal mechanism whereby the translation of
	genetic information into spatial patterns of differentiation is achieved.
	The basis of this is a mechanism whereby the cells in a developing
	system may have their position specified with respect to one or more
	points in the system. This specification of position is positional
	information. Cells which have their positional information specified
	with respect to the same set of points constitute a field. Positional
	information largely determines with respect to the cells' genome
	and developmental history the nature of its molecular differentiation.
	The specification of positional information in general precedes and
	is independent of molecular differentiation. The concept of positional
	information implies a co-ordinate system and polarity is defined
	as the direction in which positional information is specified or
	measured. Rules for the specification of positional information and
	polarity are discussed. Pattern regulation, which is the ability
	of the system to form the pattern even when parts are removed, or
	added, and to show size invariance as in the French Flag problem,
	is largely dependent on the ability of the cells to change their
	positional information and interpret this change. These concepts
	are applied in some detail to early sea urchin development, hydroid
	regeneration, pattern formation in the insect epidermis, and the
	development of the chick limb. It is concluded that these concepts
	provide a unifying framework within which a wide variety of patterns
	formed from fields may be discussed, and give new meaning to classical
	concepts such as induction, dominance and field. The concepts direct
	attention towards finding mechanisms whereby position and polarity
	are specified, and the nature of reference points and boundaries.
	More specifically, it is suggested that the mechanism is required
	to specify the position of about 50 cells in a line, relatively reliably,
	in about 10 hours. The size of embryonic fields is, surprisingly,
	usually less than 50 cells in any direction.},

In the vertebrate neural tube, Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) acts as a morphogen to control the pattern of neuronal subtype specification. Using an inÂ vivo reporter of Shh signaling, mouse genetics, and systems modeling, we show that a spatially and temporally changing gradient of Shh signaling is interpreted by the regulatory logic of a downstream transcriptional network. The design of the network, which links three transcription factors to Shh signaling, is responsible for differential spatial and temporal gene expression. In addition, the network renders cells insensitive to fluctuations in signaling and confers hysteresisâmemory of the signal. Our findings reveal that morphogen interpretation is an emergent property of the architecture of a transcriptional network that provides robustness and reliability to tissue patterning.},

Despite distinct evolutionary origins and differences in time scales, cell biology and molecular players, both tissues exhibit striking similarities in the regulatory systems that establish gene expression patterns that foreshadow the arrangement of cell types. First, signaling gradients establish initial conditions that polarize the tissue, but there is no strict correspondence between specific morphogen thresholds and boundary positions. Second, gradients initiate transcriptional networks that integrate broadly distributed activators and localized repressors to generate patterns of gene expression. Third, the correct positioning of boundaries depends on the temporal and spatial dynamics of the transcriptional networks. These similarities reveal design principles that are likely to be broadly applicable to morphogen-patterned tissues.},

Recent studies use biophysical models, genetics, and quantitative imaging to unravel how tissue-level morphogen behavior arises from subcellular events. Moreover, data from several systems show that morphogen gradients, downstream signaling, and the activity of cell-intrinsic transcriptional networks change dynamically during pattern formation. Studies from Drosophila and now also vertebrates suggest that transcriptional network dynamics are central to the generation of gene expression patterns. Together, this leads to the view that pattern formation is an emergent behavior that results from the coordination of events occurring across molecular, cellular, and tissue scales.

	abstract = {Abstract All vertebrates have a spinal cord with dimensions and shape specific to their species. Yet how species-specific organ size and shape are achieved is a fundamental unresolved question in biology. The formation and sculpting of organs begins during embryonic development. As it develops, the spinal cord extends in anteriorâposterior direction in synchrony with the overall growth of the body. The dorsoventral (DV) and apicobasal lengths of the spinal cord neuroepithelium also change, while at the same time a characteristic pattern of neural progenitor subtypes along the DV axis is established and elaborated. At the basis of these changes in tissue size and shape are biophysical determinants, such as the change in cell number, cell size and shape, and anisotropic tissue growth. These processes are controlled by global tissue-scale regulators, such as morphogen signaling gradients as well as mechanical forces. Current challenges in the field are to uncover how these tissue-scale regulatory mechanisms are translated to the cellular and molecular level, and how regulation of distinct cellular processes gives rise to an overall defined size. Addressing these questions will help not only to achieve a better understanding of how size is controlled, but also of how tissue size is coordinated with the specification of pattern.

	abstract = {Cells in a developing embryo have no direct way of "measuring" their physical position. Through a variety of processes, however, the expression levels of multiple genes come to be correlated with position, and these expression levels thus form a code for "positional information." We show how to measure this information, in bits, using the gap genes in the Drosophila embryo as an example. Individual genes carry nearly two bits of information, twice as much as expected if the expression patterns consisted only of on/off domains separated by sharp boundaries. Taken together, four gap genes carry enough information to define a cell's location with an error bar of $\sim$1\% along the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo. This precision is nearly enough for each cell to have a unique identity, which is the maximum information the system can use, and is nearly constant along the length of the embryo. We argue that this constancy is a signature of optimality in the transmission of information from primary morphogen inputs to the output of the gap gene network.},

We show, in the vertebrate neural tube, using perturbations of coding and regulatory regions, that the structure of the regulatory network contributes to boundary precision. This is achieved, not by reducing noise in individual genes, but by the configuration of the network modulating the ability of stochastic fluctuations to initiate gene expression changes. We use a computational screen to identify network properties that influence boundary precision, revealing two dynamical mechanisms by which small gene circuits attenuate the effect of noise in order to increase patterning precision.

In making such inferences from morphogen profiles, cells must contend with inherent stochasticity in morphogen production, transport, sensing and signalling. Motivated by the multitude of signalling mechanisms in various developmental contexts, we show how cells may utilise multiple tiers of processing (compartmentalisation) and parallel branches (multiple receptor types), together with feedback control, to bring about fidelity in morphogenetic decoding of their positions within a developing tissue. By simultaneously deploying specific and nonspecific receptors, cells achieve a more accurate and robust inference. We explore these ideas in the patterning of \textit{Drosophila melanogaster} wing imaginal disc by Wingless morphogen signalling, where multiple endocytic pathways participate in decoding the morphogen gradient. The geometry of the inference landscape in the high dimensional space of parameters provides a measure for robustness and delineates \textit{stiff} and \textit{sloppy} directions. This distributed information processing at the scale of the cell highlights how local cell autonomous control facilitates global tissue scale design.},

Quantitative tests of this idea, however, require a theoretical framework capable of exposing the rules and precision of cell specification over developmental time. We use the gap gene network in the early fly embryo as an example to show how expression levels of the four gap genes can be jointly decoded into an optimal specification of position with 1\% accuracy. The decoder correctly predicts, with no free parameters, the dynamics of pair-rule expression patterns at different developmental time points and in various mutant backgrounds. Precise cellular identities are thus available at the earliest stages of development, contrasting the prevailing view of positional information being slowly refined across successive layers of the patterning network.

	abstract = { Half a century after Lewis Wolpert's seminal conceptual advance on how cellular fates distribute in space, we provide a brief historical perspective on how the concept of positional information emerged and influenced the field of developmental biology and beyond. We focus on a modern interpretation of this concept in terms of information theory, largely centered on its application to cell specification in the early Drosophila embryo. We argue that a true physical variable (position) is encoded in local concentrations of patterning molecules, that this mapping is stochastic, and that the processes by which positions and corresponding cell fates are determined based on these concentrations need to take such stochasticity into account. With this approach, we shift the focus from biological mechanisms, molecules, genes and pathways to quantitative systems-level questions: where does positional information reside, how it is transformed and accessed during development, and what fundamental limits it is subject to? },

Here, we discuss the interplay between expression noise and gene regulatory network at different levels of organization, ranging from a single regulatory interaction to entire regulatory networks. We then consider how this interplay impacts a variety of phenomena, such as pathogenicity, disease, adaptation to changing environments, differential cell-fate outcome and incomplete or partial penetrance effects.

	abstract = {Gene expression is a stochastic, or "noisy," process. This noise comes about in two ways. The inherent stochasticity of biochemical processes such as transcription and translation generates "intrinsic" noise. In addition, fluctuations in the amounts or states of other cellular components lead indirectly to variation in the expression of a particular gene and thus represent "extrinsic" noise. Here, we show how the total variation in the level of expression of a given gene can be decomposed into its intrinsic and extrinsic components. We demonstrate theoretically that simultaneous measurement of two identical genes per cell enables discrimination of these two types of noise. Analytic expressions for intrinsic noise are given for a model that involves all the major steps in transcription and translation. These expressions give the sensitivity to various parameters, quantify the deviation from Poisson statistics, and provide a way of fitting experiment. Transcription dominates the intrinsic noise when the average number of proteins made per mRNA transcript is greater than approximately 2. Below this number, translational effects also become important. Gene replication and cell division, included in the model, cause protein numbers to tend to a limit cycle. We calculate a general form for the extrinsic noise and illustrate it with the particular case of a single fluctuating extrinsic variable-a repressor protein, which acts on the gene of interest.

Given a framework for describing regulatory interactions and dynamics, we consider in the space of all regulatory networks those that have prescribed functional capabilities. Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling is then used to determine how these functional networks lead to specific motif statistics in the interactions. In the case where the regulatory networks are constrained to exhibit multistability, we find a high frequency of gene pairs that are mutually inhibitory and self-activating. In contrast, networks constrained to have periodic gene expression patterns (mimicking for instance the cell cycle) have a high frequency of bifan-like motifs involving four genes with at least one activating and one inhibitory interaction.},

	abstract = {Pattern formation during development is a highly dynamic process. In spite of this, few experimental and modelling approaches take into account the explicit time-dependence of the rules governing regulatory systems. We address this problem by studying dynamic morphogen interpretation by the gap gene network in Drosophila melanogaster. Gap genes are involved in segment determination during early embryogenesis. They are activated by maternal morphogen gradients encoded by bicoid (bcd) and caudal (cad). These gradients decay at the same time-scale as the establishment of the antero-posterior gap gene pattern. We use a reverse-engineering approach, based on data-driven regulatory models called gene circuits, to isolate and characterise the explicitly time-dependent effects of changing morphogen concentrations on gap gene regulation. To achieve this, we simulate the system in the presence and absence of dynamic gradient decay. Comparison between these simulations reveals that maternal morphogen decay controls the timing and limits the rate of gap gene expression. In the anterior of the embyro, it affects peak expression and leads to the establishment of smooth spatial boundaries between gap domains. In the posterior of the embryo, it causes a progressive slow-down in the rate of gap domain shifts, which is necessary to correctly position domain boundaries and to stabilise the spatial gap gene expression pattern. We use a newly developed method for the analysis of transient dynamics in non-autonomous (time-variable) systems to understand the regulatory causes of these effects. By providing a rigorous mechanistic explanation for the role of maternal gradient decay in gap gene regulation, our study demonstrates that such analyses are feasible and reveal important aspects of dynamic gene regulation which would have been missed by a traditional steady-state approach. More generally, it highlights the importance of transient dynamics for understanding complex regulatory processes in development.},

Many regulatory networks exhibit modular behaviour without structural modularity. Here we partition an experimentally tractable regulatory networkâthe gap gene system of dipteran insectsâusing an alternative approach. We show that this system, although not structurally modular, is composed of dynamical modules driving different aspects of whole-network behaviour. All these subcircuits share the same regulatory structure, but differ in components and sensitivity to regulatory interactions. Some subcircuits are in a state of criticality, while others are not, which explains the observed differential evolvability of the various expression features in the system.},

This diversity is not just simple noise but has biological relevance by generating plasticity. Noise driven plasticity was suggested to be a stem cell-specific feature.  Results Here we show that the phenotypes of proliferating tissue progenitor cells such as primary mononuclear muscle cells can also spontaneously fluctuate between different states characterized by the either high or low expression of the muscle-specific cell surface molecule CD56 and by the corresponding high or low capacity to form myotubes. Although this capacity is a cell-intrinsic property, the cells switch their phenotype under the constraints imposed by the highly heterogeneous microenvironment created by their own collective movement. The resulting heterogeneous cell population is characterized by a dynamic equilibrium between âhigh CD56â and âlow CD56â phenotype cells with distinct spatial distribution. Computer simulations reveal that this complex dynamic is consistent with a context-dependent noise driven bistable model where local microenvironment acts on the cellular state by encouraging the cell to fluctuate between the phenotypes until the low noise state is found.  Conclusions These observations suggest that phenotypic fluctuations may be a general feature of any non-terminally differentiated cell. The cellular microenvironment created by the cells themselves contributes actively and continuously to the generation of fluctuations depending on their phenotype. As a result, the cell phenotype is determined by the joint action of the cell-intrinsic fluctuations and by collective cell-to-cell interactions.},

While these sources are usually studied separately, we develop an agent-based framework that accounts for both factors while tracking every single cell of a growing population. Apart from the common intrinsic variability, the framework also predicts extrinsic noise without the need to introduce fluctuating rate constants. Instead, extrinsic fluctuations are explained by cell cycle fluctuations and differences in cell age. We provide explicit formulas to quantify mean molecule numbers, intrinsic and extrinsic noise statistics in two-colour experiments. We find that these statistics differ significantly depending on the experimental setup used to observe the cells. We illustrate this fact using (i) averages over an isolated cell lineage tracked over many generations as observed in the mother machine, (ii) population snapshots with known cell ages as recorded in time-lapse microscopy, and (iii) snapshots with unknown cell ages as measured from static images or flow cytometry. Applying the method to models of stochastic gene expression and feedback regulation elucidates that isolated lineages, as compared to snapshot data, can significantly overestimate the mean number of molecules, overestimate extrinsic noise but underestimate intrinsic noise and have qualitatively different sensitivities to cell cycle fluctuations.},

The results from many in-depth analyses and genome-scale surveys have suggested how such fluctuations arise and spread, often in ways consistent with stochastic models of transcription and translation. But fluctuations also arise during cell division when molecules are partitioned stochastically between the two daughters. Here we mathematically demonstrate how stochastic partitioning contributes to the non-genetic heterogeneity. Our results show that partitioning errors are hard to correct, and that the resulting noise profiles are remarkably difficult to separate from gene expression noise. By applying these results to common experimental strategies and distinguishing between creation versus transmission of noise, we hypothesize that much of the cell-to-cell heterogeneity that has been attributed to various aspects of gene expression instead comes from random segregation at cell division. We propose experiments to separate between these two types of fluctuations and discuss future directions. {\textcopyright} 2011 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.},

    abstract = {Morphogen gradients provide positional information during development. To uncover the minimal requirements for morphogen gradient formation, we have engineered a synthetic morphogen in Drosophila wing primordia. We show that an inert protein, green fluorescent protein (GFP), can form a detectable diffusion-based gradient in the presence of surface-associated anti-GFP nanobodies, which modulate the gradient by trapping the ligand and limiting leakage from the tissue. We next fused anti-GFP nanobodies to the receptors of Dpp, a natural morphogen, to render them responsive to extracellular GFP. In the presence of these engineered receptors, GFP could replace Dpp to organize patterning and growth in vivo. Concomitant expression of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored nonsignaling receptors further improved patterning, to near-wild-type quality. Theoretical arguments suggest that GPI anchorage could be important for these receptors to expand the gradient length scale while at the same time reducing leakage.},

    abstract = {Cells within developing tissues rely on morphogens to assess positional information. Passive diffusion is the most parsimonious transport model for long-range morphogen gradient formation but does not, on its own, readily explain scaling, robustness and planar transport. Here, we argue that diffusion is sufficient to ensure robust morphogen gradient formation in a variety of tissues if the interactions between morphogens and their extracellular binders are considered. A current challenge is to assess how the affinity for extracellular binders, as well as other biophysical and cell biological parameters, determines gradient dynamics and shape in a diffusion-based transport system. Technological advances in genome editing, tissue engineering, live imaging and in vivo biophysics are now facilitating measurement of these parameters, paving the way for mathematical modelling and a quantitative understanding of morphogen gradient formation and modulation.},

    abstract = {Metazoan embryos develop from a single cell into three-dimensional structured organisms while groups of genetically identical cells attain specialized identities. Cells of the developing embryo both create and accurately interpret morphogen gradients to determine their positions and make specific decisions in response. Here, we first cover intellectual roots of morphogen and positional information concepts. Focusing on animal embryos, we then provide a review of current understanding on how morphogen gradients are established and how their spans are controlled. Lastly, we cover how gradients evolve in time and space during development, and how they encode information to control patterning. In sum, we provide a list of patterning principles for morphogen gradients and review recent advances in quantitative methodologies elucidating information provided by morphogens.},

	abstract = {Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) act in dose-dependent fashion to regulate cell fate choices in a myriad of developmental contexts. In early vertebrate and invertebrate embryos, BMPs and their antagonists establish epidermal versus central nervous system domains. In this highly conserved system, BMP antagonists mediate the neural-inductive activities proposed by Hans Spemann and Hilde Mangold nearly a century ago. BMPs distributed in gradients subsequently function as morphogens to subdivide the three germ layers into distinct territories and act to organize body axes, regulate growth, maintain stem cell niches, or signal inductively across germ layers. In this Review, we summarize the variety of mechanisms that contribute to generating reliable developmental responses to BMP gradients and other morphogen systems.},

	abstract = {Despite its fundamental importance for development, the question of how organs achieve their correct size and shape is poorly understood. This complex process requires coordination between the generation of cell mass and the morphogenetic mechanisms that sculpt tissues. These processes are regulated by morphogen signalling pathways and mechanical forces. Yet, in many systems, it is unclear how biochemical and mechanical signalling are quantitatively interpreted to determine the behaviours of individual cells and how they contribute to growth and morphogenesis at the tissue scale. In this review, we discuss the development of the vertebrate neural tube and somites as an example of the state of knowledge, as well as the challenges in understanding the mechanisms of tissue size control in vertebrate organogenesis. We highlight how the recent advances in stem cell differentiation and organoid approaches can be harnessed to provide new insights into this question.}
