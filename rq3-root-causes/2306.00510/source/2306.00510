In this paper we investigate locally nilpotent derivations on the polynomial algebra in three variables over a field of characteristic zero. We introduce an iterating construction giving all locally nilpotent derivations of rank $2$. This construction allows to get examples of non-triangularizable locally nilpotent derivations of rank $2$. We also show that the well-known example of a locally nilpotent derivation of rank $3$, given by Freudenburg, is a member of a large family of new examples of rank $3$ locally nilpotent derivations. Our approach is based on considering all locally nilpotent derivations commuting with a given one. We obtain a characterization of locally nilpotent derivations with a given rank in terms of sets of commuting locally nilpotent derivations.

\section{Introduction}
By a ring, we mean a Noetherian ring with unity. Let $k$ be a field of characteristic zero and $B$ be a $k$-algebra. We use the notation $B=k^{[n]}$ to denote that $B$ is isomorphic to the polynomial algebra in $n$ variables over $k$. A $k$-linear map $\delta : B \rightarrow B$ is said to be a $k$-{\it derivation} if it satisfies the Leibnitz rule: $\delta(ab)=a\delta(b)+b\delta(a)$ for all $a,b \in B$. A $k$-derivation $\delta$ is a said to be a {\it locally nilpotent derivation} (abbrev. LND) if, for each $b \in B$, there exits $n(b) \in \bN$ such that $\delta^{n(b)}(b)=0$. The $B$-subalgebra $A:=\{ b \in B~\vert ~ \delta(b)=0\}$ is called the {\it kernel} of $\delta$ and denoted by ${\rm Ker}~\delta$. The set of all LNDs of $B$ is denoted by ${\rm LND}(B)$.


When $k$ is algebraically closed, the group of regular automorphisms $\mathrm{Aut}(k^{[n]})$ is a classical object of investigation in affine algebraic geometry.  There are a lot of famous long standing problems about $\mathrm{Aut}(k^{[n]})$ such as Jacobian conjecture, Linearization problem, Tameness problem and so on. One of the approaches to study $\mathrm{Aut}(k^{[n]})$  is to study all algebraic subgroups in it. Each connected linear algebraic group is generated by one-dimensional subgroups isomorphic to the additive or the multiplicative group of $k$. We call such subgroups $\mathbb{G}_a$ and $\mathbb{G}_m$-subgroups, respectively. The $\mathbb{G}_a$-subgroups correspond to locally nilpotent derivations  of $k^{[n]}$.

 LNDs  became a powerful tool for investigating $k$-algebras.  In 1996, Makar-Limanov~\cite{ML} introduced a new invariant of a $k$-algebra $B$, which was later named the {\it Makar-Limanov invariant}. It is the intersection of kernels of all LNDs on $B$ and is denoted by ${\rm ML}(B)$. This invariant allows one to prove that the  Koras-Russell cubic $\{x+x^2y+z^2+t^3=0\}$ is not isomorphic to the three dimensional affine space. Generalization of this result given by Kaliman and Makar-Limanov  in 1997 was the final step in the proof of the Linearization problem for $\mathbb{C}^*$-action on $\mathbb{C}^3$ \cite{KML}. One can also use ${\rm ML}(B)$ for the purpose of describing all automorphisms of a $k$-algebra $B$ \cite{ML2, MJ,P,Gai}.  In~\cite{DaGu},  characterizations of $k^{[2]}$ and $k^{[3]}$ in terms of the Makar-Limanov invariant are obtained.


Another popular concept based on the concept of LNDs is that of flexibility of an affine algebraic variety. Let $\mathrm{SAut}(X)$ denote the group generated by all $\mathbb{G}_a$-subgroups in $\mathrm{Aut}(k[X])$, where $k[X]$ is the algebra of regular functions on an affine algebraic variety $X$. In \cite{AFKKZ} it is proved that if $\mathrm{SAut}(X)$ acts on the regular locus $X^{reg}$ transitively, then it acts on  $X^{reg}$ infinitely transitively, i.e. every  $m$-tuple $\{a_1,\ldots, a_m\}$ of distinct points in $X^{reg}$ can be moved to any $m$-tuple $\{b_1,\ldots, b_m\}$ of distinct points in $X^{reg}$ by an element of $\mathrm{SAut}(X)$. Such varieties are called {\it flexible}. It turns out that many natural classes of varieties including affine spaces are flexible \cite{AKZ, AFKKZ, GSh, Pe}.


Although LNDs are popular objects of investigation, even for many well-known algebras it is a complicated problem to describe all LNDs on these algebras. For example, in case of the polynomial algebra $k^{[n]}$, there is no complete description starting from $n=3$. For $n=1$, each LND of $k[x]$ has the form $c\frac{\partial}{\partial x}$, where $c\in k$.  For $n=2$, each LND of $k[x,y]$ has the form $f(u)\frac{\partial}{\partial v}$, where $\{u,v\}$ is a coordinate system of $k^{[2]}$, i.e. $k[x,y]=k[u,v]$ (Theorem \ref{R}). When $n\geqslant 3$, there is no such explicit description of an arbitrary LND, but there are many known examples. Indeed, each {\it triangularizable} derivation is an LND. By a triangularizable derivation, we mean a derivation $\delta$ on $k^{[n]}$ such that in some coordinate system $\{x_1,\ldots, x_n\}$ we have $\delta (x_i)\in k[x_1,\ldots, x_{i-1}]$, in particular, $\delta(x_1)\in k$.  For $n=3$, there exists a complete description of LNDs which contain at least one variable in its kernel, given by Daigle and Freudenburg (Theorem \ref{df}).  It seems that starting from $n=4$ the situation becomes very difficult. An important technique to study an LND is by investigating its kernel. Indeed, it is easy to see  that for $n\leqslant 2$ the kernel of any non-zero LND of $k^{[n]}$ is a polynomial ring. For $n=3$, this fact is the statement of Miyanishi's theorem \cite[Theorem~5.1]{F}. But for $n\geqslant 5$ the kernel of an LND can be even non finitely generated~\cite{DF}. For $n=4$, though it is known that the kernel of an LND is finitely generated if it annihilates a variable \cite[Theorem 1]{BhD} and is also a polynomial ring if in addition, the kernel is regular \cite{BGL}, the question of finite generation of the kernel remains open in general.  That is why our paper is devoted to the case $n=3$. This paper is an attempt to understand how do LNDs on $k[x,y,z]$ look like.

If $\delta$ is an LND and $h\in \mathrm{Ker}\,\delta$, then $h\delta$ is also an LND, which is called a {\it replica} of $\delta$. So, to investigate all LNDs in some sense it is sufficient to investigate irreducible ones, i.e. LNDs whose image is not contained in any non-trivial principal ideal. Indeed, all LNDs are replicas of irreducible ones. Each derivation of $k[x_1,\ldots, x_n]$ has the form 
$$
\delta=f_1\frac{\partial}{\partial x_1}+\ldots+f_n\frac{\partial}{\partial x_n}, \qquad \text{where} \quad f_i\in k[x_1,\ldots, x_n].
$$
If we change the system of coordinates, i.e. consider such $y_1,\ldots, y_n$ that $k[y_1,\ldots, y_n]=k[x_1,\ldots, x_n]$, then $\delta$ has the form 
$$\widetilde{f}_1\frac{\partial}{\partial y_1}+\ldots+\widetilde{f}_n\frac{\partial}{\partial y_n}, \qquad \widetilde{f}_i\in k[y_1,\ldots, y_n].$$
The minimal number of non-zero $\widetilde{f}_1,\ldots, \widetilde{f}_n$ for various systems of coordinates is called {\it rank} of the derivation $\delta$, denoted by $\mathrm{rk}~\delta$.  If $\mathrm{rk}\,\delta =0$, then $\delta=0$. Every LND of rank $1$  is a replica of the derivation $\frac{\partial}{\partial x_1}$ in some coordinate system $\{x_1, \dots ,x_n\}$ of $k^{[n]}$ (Proposition \ref{fr95c}). It is easy to prove that a replica of a triangularizable derivation has rank at most $n-1$. But the converse is not true even for $n=3$. On $k^{[3]}$, there are examples of non-triangularizable irreducible LNDs of rank 2. The first example of a non-triangularizable LND of $k^{[3]}$ was given by Bass \cite{B}, which was generalized to $k^{[n]}$ for $n \geqslant 4$ by Popov \cite{Po}. More examples were given by Freudenburg \cite[Example 2]{F95} and Daigle \cite[Example 3.5]{D96}. Later,  Freudenburg~\cite{F98} proved that there exist LNDs on $k^{[3]}$ of rank $3$. This example of Freudenburg (see Section \ref{rk3der}) is given by some rather complicated polynomials. The proof that this LND is of rank $3$, is based on the fact that it is homogeneous with respect to a $\mathbb{Z}$-grading on $B$. Later, he introduced the technique of local slice constructions \cite{Fr97} to generalize this example and obtained new examples of rank~$3$ LNDs. Similar examples were also obtained by Daigle, who used a geometric approach. The connection between his geometric approach and local slice constructions is described in \cite{Da07}. However, the examples of ${\rm rk}~3$ derivations obtained by these methods were all homogeneous with respect to some positive $\mathbb{Z}$ gradings.
%It seems that his proof can not be applied to any nonhomogeneous LND. 


Our approach to studying LNDs of $k^{[3]}$ is based on investigating all LNDs that commute with a fixed one. It is easy to see that, given any LND $\delta$,  all LNDs equivalent to $\delta$ commute with $\delta$. Recall that, two LNDs are called {\it equivalent} if their kernels coincide. We prove the following characterization of irreducible LNDs of rank $3$: {\it an irreducible LND $\delta$ of $k^{[3]}$ has rank 3 if and only if every LND commuting with it is equivalent to $\delta$} (see Theorem~\ref{rk2thm1}). Note that, for a reducible LND, it is not true. We give an explicit criterion for an LND to have a non-equivalent commuting one (see Proposition \ref{rk2com1}). It allows us to construct LNDs even of rank $1$ without non-equivalent commuting ones. For example, one can consider the derivation $xy\dfrac{\partial}{\partial z}$ on $k[x,y,z]$. We also prove that each LND of $k^{[3]}$ can be restricted to a canonical (possibly, proper) subalgebra of $k^{[3]}$ isomorphic to $k^{[3]}$, such that the restriction is an LND of rank one. We prove that if a restriction of an irreducible LND has no non-equivalent commuting LNDs then the initial LND $\delta$ also has no non-equivalent commuting LNDs and hence has rank $3$ (Remark~\ref{nepsam} and Proposition~\ref{rrr}). This allows to obtain a new proof that Freudenburg's example is of rank $3$ and to construct new non-homogeneous examples of rank $3$ LNDs (Theorem \ref{rk3final}). In some sense, our approach explains why these LNDs are of rank $3$.


In this paper, we develop a new technique to obtain new LNDs via chains of commuting LNDs starting form basic partial derivations. We prove that every irreducible LND on $k^{[n]}$ of rank at most $2$ can be obtained by an iterative construction from partial derivations in some coordinate system (Corollary \ref{CLNDC3var}). We call this construction as the {\it Modified Commuting LND Construction} (abbrev. MC-construction). It has a close connection with amalgamated product structure of $\mathrm{Aut}(k^{[2]})$.  The minimal number of steps of this construction is defined to be the {\it level} of the LND. This gives a new numerical characteristic, which shows how complicated the LND is. The simplest LNDs of rank at most $2$ are LNDs of rank $1$, then come the triangularizable LNDs. As the level of an LND depends on the choice of coordinate system, one can take the minimum over a suitable collection of coordinate systems. That minimum number is called the {\it universal level} of $D$. We show that an LND has rank $1$ if and only if it has universal level $1$ and it is triangularizable if and only if it has universal level $3$ (Theorem \ref{crtr}). In our definition, no LND has universal level $2$. Using the MC-construction technique, we construct a new family of non-triangularizable LNDs of rank 2 (Example~\ref{ex1}). These examples are different from the earlier examples of Freudenburg \cite{F95} and Daigle \cite{D96}. In a forthcoming paper, we will give a description of the isotropy subgroup of an LND of $k^{[3]}$, i.e. the subgroup of ${\rm Aut}(k^{[3]})$ consisting of all automorphisms of $k^{[3]}$ commuting with this LND.









 

\section{Preliminaries}

%\subsection{Automorphisms of polynomial ring}
For a ring $R$, we denote the multiplicative group of units by $R^*$. Let $k^{[n]}$ be the polynomial ring in $n$ variables over $k$. We say that $\mathbf{x}=\{x_1, \dots, x_n\}$, $x_i\in k^{[n]}$ is a {\it coordinate system} or {\it system of variables} if $k^{[n]}=k[x_1, \dots, x_n]$. By a {\it coordinate} or a {\it variable} we mean such an element that it can be included in a coordinate system. If $\alpha$ is an automorphism of $k^{[n]}$ such that $\alpha (x_i)=f_i$, then we use the notation $\alpha=(f_1,\ldots,f_n)$.

\begin{defn}
{\em For a coordinate system $\mathbf{x}=\{x_1, \dots, x_n\}$ of $k^{[n]}$, an automorphsim $\alpha=(f_1, \dots ,f_n)$ is said to be {\it triangular} if $f_i \in k[x_1, \dots ,x_i]$ for each $i$, $1 \leqslant i\leqslant  n$. We denote the subgroup of triangular automorphisms by ${\rm T}_n(k; \mathbf{x})$ or more simply by ${\rm T}_n(k)$ when the coordinate system $\mathbf{x}$ is understood from the context. The subgroup of ${\rm Aut}(k^{[n]})$ generated by ${\rm GL}_n(k)$ and the triangular automorphisms is called the {\it tame subgroup} relative to the coordinate system $\mathbf{x}$, and is denoted by ${\rm TA}_n(k;\mathbf{x})$.}
\end{defn}

It is well-known that every automorphism of $k^{[2]}$ is tame. This result was first proved by Jung \cite{Ju} for characteristic zero and generalized to arbitrary characteristic by Van der Kulk~\cite{VDK}. The next theorem gives the explicit structure of ${\rm Aut}(k^{[2]})$ \cite[Theorem~4.2]{F}. Though this result was initially contained in the works of Van der Kulk, it was Nagata who stated and proved it in this exact form \cite{Na}. His proof assumed $k$ to be algebraically closed. Later, in his Ph.D. thesis, Wright proved this theorem for the general case \cite{W1}.
\begin{thm}\label{jvk}
Let $k$ be any field. Then ${\rm Aut}(k^{[2]})$ has the structure of an amalgamated free product. More precisely,
$${\rm Aut}(k^{[2]})={\rm Af}_2(k) \ast_C {\rm T}_2(k),$$
where ${\rm Af}_2(k)$ is the subgroup of affine automorphisms
$$\rm{A f}_2(k)=\left\{
\begin{pmatrix}
x\\
y
\end{pmatrix}\mapsto
\begin{pmatrix}
a_{11}x+a_{12}y+b_1\\
a_{21}x+a_{22}y+b_2
\end{pmatrix} \Big \vert  \begin{pmatrix}
a_{11}&a_{12}\\
a_{21}&a_{22}
\end{pmatrix} \in {\rm GL}_2(k)~\text{and}~b_1,b_2 \in k\ 
 \right\}.$$ and $C := {\rm Af}_2(k) \cap {\rm T}_2(k)$.
\end{thm}

\smallskip
\noindent

Let us recall some basic facts about locally nilpotent derivations. A detailed treatise in this field can be found  in the book by Freudenburg~\cite{F}. Let $B$ be an affine $k$-domain. The set of all LNDs of $B$ we denote by ${\rm LND}(B)$. Each LND $D$ induces a degree function $\deg_{D}\colon B\setminus\{0\}\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}_{\geqslant 0}$, given by $$\deg_D\,f:=m,~\text{where}~D^m(f)\neq 0~\text{and}~D^{m+1}(f)=0.$$ This degree function satisfies the usual properties of a degree function: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item [\rm (i)] $\deg_D(f+g)\leqslant \mathrm{max}\{\deg_D\,f,\deg_D\,g\}$;
\item [\rm (ii)] $\deg_D(fg)=\deg_D\,f+\deg_D\,g$.
\end{enumerate}
For each non-zero LND $D$ its kernel $A=\mathrm{Ker}\,D$ is a factorially closed subalgebra such that the transcendence degree of $B$ over $A$ equals 1, see \cite[Principle 1]{F}. Recall that, a subalgebra $A$ of an algebra $B$ is said to be factorially closed in $B$, if for any $a,b \in B$, the condition $ab \in A$ implies that both $a$ and $b$ are in $A$. If $S \subset A \setminus \{0\}$ is multiplicatively closed, then $D$ induces an LND on $S^{-1}B$ with kernel $S^{-1}A$, see \cite[Principle~9]{F}.





\begin{defn}
{\em Let $B$ be a $k$-algebra. We say two locally nilpotent derivations $D_1$ and $D_2$ of $B$ to be {\it equivalent} if ${\rm Ker}~D_1={\rm Ker}~D_2$. 
}
\end{defn}

It is well-known that two non-zero LNDs $D_1$ and $D_2$ are equivalent if and only if there exist non-zero $a,b\in B$ such that $aD_1=bD_2$.
It is easy to see that both $a$ and $b$ can be chosen in ${\rm Ker}~D_1={\rm Ker}~D_2$, see \cite[Principle 12]{F}.

\begin{defn}
{\em
Let $D\in {\rm LND}(B)$. An element $s \in B$ is called a {\it slice} if $Ds=1$, and a 
{\it local slice} if $Ds \in {\rm Ker} D$ and $Ds \neq 0$.
}
\end{defn}
A local slice exists for every non-zero LND. But the existence of a slice is a rather strict condition for an LND. The following important result is known as the Slice Theorem,  see \cite[Corollary 1.26]{F}.
\begin{thm}\label{st}
 Let $B$ a $k$-domain. Suppose $D \in {\rm LND}(B)$ admits a slice $s\in B$, and let $A={\rm Ker}~D$. Then 
$B=A[s]$ and $D=\frac{\partial}{\partial s}$.
\end{thm}

\smallskip
\noindent
The following assertion, see~\cite[Principle~11(d)]{F}, is a generalization of the above theorem. 
\begin{prop}\label{proplocsl}
Let $r$ be a local slice of $D$. Then the following holds $B\left[\frac{1}{D(r)}\right]=A\left[\frac{1}{D(r)}\right][r]$.
\end{prop}



Now we assume $B=k^{[n]}$. We start with the result, due to Rentschler \cite{Re}, which characterizes all locally nilpotent derivations on~$k^{[2]}$.
\begin{thm}\label{R}
Let $D$  be a non-zero LND of $k[x,y]$. There there exists a tame automorphism $\alpha \in TA_2(k; \{x,y\})$ and $p(x) \in k[x]$ such that $\alpha D  {\alpha}^{-1}=p(x)\dfrac{\partial }{\partial y}.$
\end{thm}

In particular, it follows from this theorem that the kernel of any non-zero LND of $k^{[2]}$ is isomorphic to $k^{[1]}$. 
The next theorem is a famous result of Miyanishi which gives the structure of the kernel of any non-zero LND on $k^{[3]}$, see \cite[Theorem 5.1]{F}.
\begin{thm}\label{miya}
Let $D (\neq 0 ) \in {\rm LND}(k^{[3]})$. Then ${\rm Ker}~D \cong k^{[2]}$.
\end{thm}

\begin{defn}{\em
The {\it rank} of $D$, denoted by $\mathrm{rk}\,D$, is defined to be the least integer $i$ for which
there exists a coordinate system $\{x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n\}$ of $B$ satisfying 
$$k[x_{i+1},\dots,x_n]\subseteq \mathrm{Ker}\,D.$$
}
\end{defn}
\noindent
It is easy to see that this definition is equivalent to the definition of rank given in the introduction. If $\mathrm{rk}\, D=0$, then $D=0$. So, for any non-zero LND  $D$, $1\leqslant \mathrm{rk}\,D\leqslant n$.





\smallskip
Let $B$ be an affine $k$-domain and $D\in {\rm LND}(B)$ with the kernel $A$ and the image $DB$. It can be proved that the intersection of the kernel and the image $A\cap DB$ is an ideal in $A$. It is called {\it plinth} ideal and is denoted by $\mathrm{pl}(D)$.
The following result called the Plinth Ideal Theorem follows from the works of Bonnet \cite{Bo} and Daigle-Kaliman \cite{DK}.
\begin{thm}\label{pl}
Let $B=k^{[3]}$, $D \in {\rm LND}(B)$ and $A={\rm Ker}~D$. Then the following hold:
\begin{enumerate}
\item [\rm (i)] $B$ is a faithfully flat $A$-module;
\item [\rm (ii)] the plinth ideal $\mathrm{pl}(D)$ is principal.
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm} 
\smallskip
\noindent
\begin{defn}
{\em 
Let $B=k^{[3]}$, $D \in {\rm LND}(B)$. A local slice $r$ is called a {\it minimal local slice} of $D$ if $D(r)$ is a generator of the plinth ideal $A \cap DB$.
}
\end{defn}

\smallskip
\noindent
The following result due to Freudenburg characterizes rank $1$ LNDs of $k^{[n]}$, see \cite{F95}.
\begin{prop}\label{fr95c}
Up to a change of coordinates, every locally nilpotent derivation $D$ of $rank~1$ on $k[x_1, \dots , x_n]$ is of the form $D=h\dfrac{\partial}{\partial x_n}$ where $h \in k[x_1, \dots ,x_{n-1}]$.
\end{prop}

\smallskip
\noindent
We next state an important result on the intersection of kernels of LNDs of $k^{[3]}$ \cite[Theorem~5.13]{F}.
\begin{thm}\label{3varint}
Let $D_1,D_2 \in {\rm LND}(k^{[3]})$. \mbox{Then exactly one of the following statements holds:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item [\rm (i)] ${\rm Ker}~D_1 \cap {\rm Ker}~D_2=k$;
\item [\rm (ii)] there exist $f,g,h \in B$ such that ${\rm Ker}~D_1=k[f,g]$, ${\rm Ker}~D_2=k[f,h]$ and ${\rm Ker}~D_1 \cap {\rm Ker}~D_2=k[f]$;
\item [\rm (iii)] ${\rm Ker}~D_1 ={\rm Ker}~D_2$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

\smallskip
\noindent
We are particularly interested in the case when two LNDs commute. The next result due to Daigle and Kaliman \cite[Theorem 3]{F} describes the intersection of kernels of two commuting non-equivalent LNDs of $k^{[3]}$. It was earlier observed by Maubach \cite[Theorem 3.6]{Ma} for $k=\bC$.
\begin{prop}\label{frcom}
If $D,E \in {\rm LND}(k^{[3]})$ are non-zero, commuting and have distinct kernels, then there exists a variable $f \in k^{[3]}$ such that ${\rm Ker}~D \cap {\rm Ker}~E=k[f]$.
\end{prop}

\smallskip
\noindent
The following result involving local slices of LNDs on $k^{[3]}$ is due to Daigle \cite[Lemma 2.5]{D10}.
\begin{lem}\label{dtriang}
Let $B=k^{[3]}$, $D (\neq 0) \in {\rm LND}(B)$, $A:={\rm Ker}~D$ and $f \in A$. Then the following hold:
\begin{enumerate}
\item [\rm (i)] if $f$ is a variable of $B$, then it is a variable of $A$;
\item [\rm (ii)] if $f$ is a variable of $A$ and there exists $g \in B$ such that $D(g) \in k[f] \setminus \{0\}$, then $f$ is a variable of $B$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lem}

\smallskip
\noindent
The next result due to Freudenburg \cite[Proposition 1]{F95} is called the {\it Restriction /extension} principle.
\begin{prop}\label{frext}
Let $D \in {\rm LND}(k[x_1, \dots ,x_n])$. If $D$ restricts to a derivation on $k[x_1, \dots , x_{n-1}]$. Then $Dx_n \in k[x_1, \dots , x_{n-1}]$.
\end{prop}



\smallskip
\indent
Now let us consider the polynomial ring in $n$ variables $R^{[n]}$ over a ring $R$. By an $R$-derivation, we mean a derivation vanishing on $R$. If we are given $n-1$ polynomials $f_1,\ldots, f_{n-1}$, we can consider the Jacobian derivation $\delta={\rm Jac}(f_1,\ldots, f_{n-1},\cdot)$ such that
$$
\delta(h)={\rm Jac}(f_1,\ldots, f_{n-1},h)=\det J(f_1,\ldots, f_{n-1},h),
$$
where $J$ is the Jacobian matrix. The Jacobian derivation is always an $R$-derivation, but it is not always locally nilpotent.

\smallskip
\noindent
We end this section by stating a theorem of Daigle and Freudenburg which characterizes all $R$-LNDs of $R^{[2]}$, 
where~$R$ is a UFD containing $\bQ$ \cite[Theorem 2.4]{DF}.
\begin{thm}\label{df}
Let $R$ be a UFD containing $\bQ$ with field of fractions $K$ and let $B=R[x,y]=R^{[2]}$. 
For an $R$-derivation $D\neq0$ of $B$, the following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item[\rm (i)] $D$ is locally nilpotent;
 \item[\rm (ii)] $D=\alpha {\rm Jac}(F,\cdot)$, for some $F \in B$ which is a variable of $K[x,y]$
  satisfying\\
  $gcd_B(\frac{\partial F}{\partial x},\frac{\partial F}{\partial y})=1$, and for some 
 $\alpha \in R[F] \setminus \{0\}$.

Moreover, if the above conditions are satisfied, then $Ker$ $D=R[F]=R^{[1]}$.

\section{Commuting LND Construction}\label{cln}
Let $B$ be an affine $k$-domain and $D_1,D_2 \in {\rm LND}(B)$. One may ask whether the derivation $D_1+D_2$ is also an LND. In general, it is not true but the answer is affirmative when $D_1$ and $D_2$ commute. However, this property does not hold for replicas of LNDs, i.e.,  if we have two commuting LNDs, the sum of their replicas may not be locally nilpotent. 

\begin{ex}
{\em 
Consider two commuting LNDs $\frac{\partial}{\partial x}$ and $\frac{\partial}{\partial y}$ of $k[x,y]$. The sum of their replicas $y\frac{\partial}{\partial x}+x\frac{\partial}{\partial y}$ is not locally nilpotent.
}
\end{ex}

\smallskip
\noindent
The following lemma shows that if we take replicas of a special form, then their sum is an~LND.
\begin{lem}\label{lndcommute}
Let $B$ be an affine $k$-domain and $\delta_1,\ldots, \delta_m \in {\rm LND}(B)$ be non-zero and pairwise commuting, i.e., $\delta_i\delta_j=\delta_j\delta_i$ for all $i,j \in \{1, \dots ,m\}$. Suppose 
$$f_k\in \bigcap_{i=k}^m {\rm Ker}~ \delta_i, ~~~ 1\leqslant k\leqslant m.$$ 
Then $\Delta=\sum\limits_{i=1}^n f_i\delta_i$ is an LND of $B$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
It is easy to see that $\Delta$ is a derivation of $B$. So it is enough to check that it is locally nilpotent. Let us fix $g\in B$. There exist positive integers $l_1,\ldots, l_m$ that 
$\delta_j^{l_j}\left(g\prod_{i=j+1}^mf_i^{l_i} \right)=0$. Set $e=l_1+\ldots+l_m-m+1$. Then 
$$
f_{a_1}\delta_{a_1}\circ\ldots\circ f_{a_e}\delta_{a_e}(g)=0.
$$
Indeed, if $m$ occurs among $a_1,\ldots, a_e$ at least $l_m$ times, then since $\delta_m$ commutes with $f_i$ and~$\delta_i$ we have for some~$\psi$:
$$
f_{a_1}\delta_{a_1}\circ\ldots\circ f_{a_e}\delta_{a_e}(g)=\psi\circ \delta_m^{l_m}(g)=0.
$$
Note, that $\delta_{m-1}$ commutes with all $f_i$ and $\delta_i$, except $f_m$. If $m$ occurs among $a_1,\ldots, a_s$ less than $l_m$ times and $m-1$ occurs among $a_1,\ldots, a_s$ at least $l_{m-1}$ times, then we have for some~$\psi$:
$$
f_{a_1}\delta_{a_1}\circ\ldots\circ f_{a_e}\delta_{a_e}(g)=\psi\circ\delta_{m-1}^{b_1}f_m^{c_1}\circ\ldots\circ\delta_{m-1}^{b_t}f_m^{c_t}\circ\delta_{m-1}^{b_{t+1}}(g),
$$
where $\sum \limits_{i=1}^{t+1} b_i\geqslant l_{m-1}$, $\sum \limits_{i=1}^t c_i< l_m$. We have 
$$\deg_{\delta_{m-1}}\left(\delta_{m-1}^{b_1}f_m^{c_1}\circ\ldots\circ\delta_{m-1}^{b_t}f_m^{c_t}\circ\delta_{m-1}^{b_{t+1}}(g)\right)<\deg_{\delta_{m-1}}\left(g f_m^{l_m} \right)-l_{m-1}<0.$$
This means that $\delta_{m-1}^{b_1}f_m^{c_1}\circ\ldots\circ\delta_{m-1}^{b_t}f_m^{c_t}\circ\delta_{m-1}^{b_{t+1}}(g)=0$.

Similarly we can consider cases when $i$ occurs among $a_1,\ldots, a_e$ less than $l_i$ times for all $i>j$ and $j$ occurs among $a_1,\ldots, a_s$ at least $l_i$ times. In all these cases we have 
$$
f_{a_1}\delta_{a_1}\circ\ldots\circ f_{a_e}\delta_{a_e}(g)=0.
$$
But since $e>\sum \limits_{i=1}^m(l_i-1)$, we are in one of these cases.

If we expand $\Delta^e(g)$, we obtain a sum of expressions $f_{a_1}\delta_{a_1}\circ\ldots\circ f_{a_e}\delta_{a_e}(g)$. Therefore, $\Delta^e(g)=0$.
\end{proof}


\begin{defn}
{\em 
We say that $\Delta$ in Lemma \ref{lndcommute}, is obtained by a {\it Commuting LND Construction} (denoted by $C$-{\it construction}) from $\delta_1,\ldots, \delta_m$.
}
\end{defn}
\begin{lem}
The LNDs $\Delta$ and $\delta_m$ commute.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
We have
$$
\Delta\circ\delta_m=\left(\sum\limits_{i=1}^n f_i\delta_i\right)\circ\delta_m=\sum\limits_{i=1}^n f_i\delta_i\circ\delta_m=\sum\limits_{i=1}^n f_i\delta_m\circ\delta_i=\sum\limits_{i=1}^n \delta_m\circ f_i\delta_i=\delta_m\circ\left(\sum\limits_{i=1}^n f_i\delta_i\right)=\delta_m\circ\Delta.
$$
\end{proof}

Suppose $m=2$. Starting with two commuting LNDs $\delta_1$ and $\delta_2$, by C-construction,  we obtain two commuting LNDs $\delta_2$ and $\delta_3=\Delta$. Then we can start with these two commuting LNDs and again obtain by C-construction two commuting LNDs $\delta_3$ and $\delta_4$. Iterating this procedure, we obtain a chain $\delta_1,\delta_2,\delta_3,\ldots$ , where for each $i \geqslant 2$, the derivation $\delta_i$ commutes with both $\delta_{i-1}$ and $\delta_{i+1}$. We call this chain a {\it C-chain}. A C-chain is called {\it irreducible} if all the LNDs $\delta_i$ are irreducible.






\subsection{Two variables}\label{sectwovar}

Let $B=k[x,y]$ and $\delta_1, \delta_2$ be two commuting non-equivalent LNDs. Then C-construction gives $\delta_3=\lambda \delta_1+\sigma\delta_2$, where $\sigma\in {\rm Ker}~\delta_2$, $\lambda\in k$ and $\delta_3$ commutes with $\delta_2$. It turns out that in case when $\delta_2$ is irreducible, each LND commuting with $\delta_2$ can be obtained by C-construction from $\delta_1$ and $\delta_2$.

\begin{lem}\label{dimtwo}
Suppose $D$ and $E$ are commuting non-equivalent LNDs of $B$. Assume $D$ is irreducible. Let $E'$ be an LND of $B$ commuting with $D$. Then $E'=\lambda E+\sigma D$, where $\sigma\in {\rm Ker}~ D$ and $\lambda \in k^*$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
By Theorem \ref{R}, there exist $f,g\in k[x,y]$ such that $k[x,y]=k[f,g]$ and $D=\frac{\partial}{\partial f}$. Let us consider restrictions $\varepsilon$ and $\varepsilon'$ of $E$ and $E'$ respectively to ${\rm Ker}~ D=k[g]$. Since $DE=ED$ and $DE'=E'D$, both $\varepsilon$, $\varepsilon' \in {\rm LND}(k[g])$.  So we have $\varepsilon=\mu\frac{\partial}{\partial g}$, $\varepsilon'=\mu'\frac{\partial}{\partial g}$, where $\mu, \mu' \in k$.  If $\mu=0$, then $E|_{{\rm Ker}~ D}=0$ and consequently $E$ and $D$ are equivalent, which is a contradiction. So $\mu \neq 0$. Let $\lambda=\frac{\mu'}{\mu}$ and $F=E'-\lambda E$. Then $FD=DF$ and $F(g)=0$. Since $F(g)=0$, we have $F=\sigma\frac{\partial}{\partial f}$ for some $\sigma\in B$. We have 
$\frac{\partial\sigma}{\partial f}=D(\sigma)=DF(f)=FD(f)=F(1)=0$. So, $E'=\sigma D+\lambda E$, where $\sigma=\sigma(g)\in {\rm Ker}~ D$ and $\lambda \in k^*$.
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}\label{corrin}
Let $R$ be an affine $k$-domain with field of fractions $K$. Suppose $D$ and $E$ are commuting non-equivalent $R$-LNDs of $R[x,y]$. Assume $D$ is irreducible. Let $E'$ be an $R$-LND of $R[x,y]$ commuting with $D$. Then there exist non-zero elements $s,r \in R$ and $q \in {\rm Ker}~D$ such that $sE'=r E+q D.$
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
The LNDs  $D$, $E$, and $E'$ induce LNDs of $K[x,y]$. By Lemma~\ref{dimtwo}, $E'=\lambda E+\sigma D$, where $\lambda\in K^*$, $\sigma\in K[x,y]$ and $\sigma \in {\rm Ker}~D$. There exist non-zero elements $s,r \in R$ such that $r=s\lambda\in R$ and $q=s\sigma\in R[x,y]$. Then $sE'=r E+q D$.
\end{proof}


\smallskip
\noindent 
Let $\delta \in {\rm LND}(k[x,y])$ be irreducible. By Theorem \ref{R}, there exist $f,g\in k[x,y]$ such that $k[x,y]=k[f,g]$ and $\delta=\frac{\partial}{\partial g}$. Let $\alpha$ be the automorphism of $k[x,y]$ given by $(x,y)\mapsto (f,g)$. Let us denote by $\Psi(\delta)$ the right coset $T_2(k)\alpha$. The {\it association class} of an LND $\delta$, denoted by $[\delta]$, is defined to be $\{ \zeta \in {\rm LND}(B) ~\vert~ \zeta=\lambda \delta, \lambda \in k^* \}$.

\begin{lem}\label{bij}
The mapping $\Psi$ gives a bijection between association classes of irreducible LNDs of $k[x,y]$ and right cosets of $T_2(k)$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
Let $\delta \in {\rm LND}(k[x,y])$ be irreducible. Suppose $\alpha : (x,y)\mapsto (f,g)$ and $\alpha_1\colon(x,y)\mapsto (f_1,g_1)$ be two distinct automorphisms such that $\dfrac{\partial }{\partial g}=\delta=\dfrac{\partial }{\partial g_1}.$
 Then ${\rm Ker}~ \delta=k[f]=k[f_1]$. Therefore, $f_1=af+b$, where $a \in k^*$ and $b \in k$. Then, we have $g_1=cg+P(f)$ where $c \in k^*$ and $P(f) \in k[f]$. So, right cosets $\mathrm{T}_2(k)\alpha$ and $\mathrm{T}_2(k)\alpha_1$ coincide.  Now let us consider $\lambda\delta$, $\lambda\in k^*$. It corresponds to the automorphism $\alpha' : (x,y)\mapsto (f,\frac{g}{\lambda})$. Then $\Psi(\delta)=\mathrm{T}_2(k)\alpha=\mathrm{T}_2(k)\alpha'=\Psi(\lambda\delta)$. Thus $\Psi$ induces a well-defined map from the set of association classes of $\delta$ to the set of right cosets of ${\rm T}_2(k)$. For convenience, we also call that map $\Psi$. 

\smallskip
\noindent 
Suppose $\mathrm{T}_2(k)\alpha=\mathrm{T}_2(k)\alpha_1$. Then $f_1=af+b$ and $g_1=cg+P(f)$, where $a,c \in k^*$, $b \in k$ and $P(f) \in k[f]$. Therefore, $\frac{\partial}{\partial g_1}=\frac{1}{c}\frac{\partial}{\partial g}$. This provides injectivity of $\Psi$. For each automorphism $\alpha\colon(x,y)\mapsto (f,g)$ we have $\mathrm{T}_2(k)\alpha=\Psi\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial g}\right)$. Therefore, $\Psi$ is surjective. 
\end{proof}

\begin{lem}\label{hl}
Let $\beta \in {\rm Af}_2(k)$ and $\alpha \in {\rm Aut}(k^{[2]})$. Let $D,E \in {\rm LND}(k^{[2]})$ be such that for the association classes $[D]$ and $[E]$, we have $\Psi([D])=\mathrm{T}_2(k)\alpha$ and $\Psi([E])=\mathrm{T}_2(k)\beta\circ\alpha$. Then $D$ and $E$ commute.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
Denote $\alpha(x)=f$, $\alpha(y)=g$. We can assume that $D(f)=0$, $D(g)=1$. Then
$$\beta\circ\alpha\colon
\begin{pmatrix}
x\\
y
\end{pmatrix}\mapsto
\begin{pmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} \\
a_{21} & a_{22} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}
f\\
g
\end{pmatrix}+
\begin{pmatrix}
b_1\\
b_2
\end{pmatrix},
$$ where $\begin{pmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} \\
a_{21} & a_{22} \end{pmatrix} \in {\rm GL}_2(k)$ and $b_1,b_2 \in k$.
We can further assume that 
$$E(a_{11}f+a_{12}g+b_1)=a_{11}E(f)+a_{12}E(g)=0\text{ and }E(a_{21}f+a_{22}g+b_2)=a_{21}E(f)+a_{22}E(g)=1.$$ 
Therefore, $E(f), E(g) \in k$. So, we have
$$
ED(f)=E(0)=0=DE(f), \qquad ED(g)=E(1)=0=DE(g).
$$ 
Thus, $ED=DE$.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}\label{CLNDC2var}
Each irreducible $\delta \in {\rm LND}(k^{[2]})$ can be constructed from an irreducible C-chain starting from $\delta_1=\frac{\partial}{\partial x}$ and $\delta_2=\frac{\partial}{\partial y}$. \end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Let $\alpha\in\Psi(D)$. By Theorem \ref{jvk}, we can decompose $\alpha=\xi_m\circ\ldots\circ\xi_1$, where each $\xi_j \in {\rm Af}_2(k) \cup {\rm T}_2(k)$. Consider sequence of right cosets 
$$\mathrm{T}_2(k), \mathrm{T}_2(k)\xi_1, \mathrm{T}_2(k)\xi_2\circ \xi_1, \ldots, \mathrm{T}_2(k)\xi_m\circ\ldots\circ\xi_1.$$
If two consecutive cosets in the sequence are equal, we remove one of them. Thus we obtain sequence of right cosets $\mathrm{T}_2(k)\gamma_1,\ldots, \mathrm{T}_2(k)\gamma_l$, where $\gamma_i \in {\rm Aut}(k^{[2]})$, $1 \leqslant i \leqslant l$.  Let us take $\delta_i \in {\rm LND}(k^{[2]})$ such that $\Psi(\delta_i)=\mathrm{T}_2(k)\gamma_i$. For any $i$, if $\mathrm{T}_2(k)\gamma_i =\mathrm{T}_2(k)\xi_s\circ\ldots\circ\xi_1$ and $\mathrm{T}_2(k)\gamma_{i+1} =\mathrm{T}_2(k)\xi_{s+1}\circ\xi_s\circ\ldots\circ\xi_1$, then  $\xi_{s+1} \in {\rm Af}_2(k) \setminus {\rm T}_2(k)$. By Lemma \ref{hl}, $\delta_i$ commutes with $\delta_{i-1}$ and $\delta_{i+1}$. Hence, by Lemma~\ref{dimtwo}, $\delta_{i+1}=\sigma \delta_i+\lambda \delta_{i-1}$, where $\sigma\in {\rm Ker}~\delta_i$, $\lambda\in k^*$. Since  $\alpha=\xi_m\circ\ldots\circ\xi_1$, we can put $\delta_{l}=\delta$. We start with $\gamma_1=\mathrm{id}$, $\delta_1=\frac{\partial}{\partial y}$ and define $\delta_0:=\frac{\partial}{\partial x}$. By construction, $\delta_2$ commutes with $\delta_1$. By Lemma~\ref{dimtwo}, $\delta_2$ is obtained by C-construction from $\delta_0$ and $\delta_1$. Moreover, it is irreducible. So, $\delta_0=\frac{\partial}{\partial x},\delta_1=\frac{\partial}{\partial y},\ldots, \delta_l=\delta$ is an irreducible C-chain.

\end{proof}

\begin{defn}{\em 
A C-chain, starting from $\frac{\partial}{\partial x}$ and $\frac{\partial}{\partial y}$ will be called a {\it full C-chain}.
} \end{defn}

\smallskip
\noindent
The next result is a partial converse of Lemma \ref{hl}
\begin{lem}\label{pl}
Suppose $\Delta$ and $D$ are commuting irreducible LNDs of $k^{[2]}$. Then there exist such $\alpha\in\Psi(D)$ and $\beta\in \mathrm{Af}_2(k)$ that $\beta\circ\alpha\in \Psi(\Delta)$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
It is enough to consider the case when $\Delta$ and $D$ are non-equivalent. Indeed, if $\Delta=tD$ for some $t \in k^*$, then $\Psi(\Delta)=\Psi(D)$. Now suppose we have $D=\frac{\partial}{\partial g}$, where $\tau\colon (x,y)\mapsto(f,g)$ is an automorphism from $\Psi(D)$. Denote $E=\frac{\partial}{\partial f}$. Then $DE=ED$. By Lemma \ref{dimtwo}, $\Delta=\sigma D+\lambda E$, where $\sigma\in{\rm Ker}~ D=k[f]$ and $\lambda \in k^*$. Let $h\in k[f]$ be such that $\frac{d h}{df}=\sigma$. We have $\Delta(f)=\lambda$, $\Delta(g)=\sigma$. Therefore $\Delta(\lambda g-h(f))=0$. Consider the automorphism
$$
\gamma\colon
\begin{pmatrix}
x\\
y
\end{pmatrix}\mapsto
\begin{pmatrix}
x\\
\lambda y-h(x)
\end{pmatrix}
$$
Clearly, $\gamma\in\mathrm{T}_2(k).$
Then 
$$
\alpha=\gamma\circ\tau\colon
\begin{pmatrix}
x\\
y
\end{pmatrix}\mapsto
\begin{pmatrix}
f\\
\lambda g-h(f)
\end{pmatrix}.
$$
Let us put 
$$
\beta\colon 
\begin{pmatrix}
x\\
y
\end{pmatrix}\mapsto
\begin{pmatrix}
y\\
x
\end{pmatrix},\qquad \beta\in \mathrm{Af}_2(k).
$$
We have $\alpha\in \mathrm{T}_2(k)\tau=\Psi(D)$. Choose $\delta \in {\rm LND}(k[x,y])$ such that $\Psi([\delta])=\mathrm{T}_2(k)\beta\circ\alpha$. Then $\delta(f)=\mu$, for some $\mu \in k^*$ and $\delta(\lambda  g-h(f))=0$. Hence, $\delta(g)=\frac{\mu\sigma(f)}{\lambda}$. So, $\Delta=\frac{\lambda}{\mu}\delta$, i.e. $\beta\circ\alpha\in\Psi(\Delta)$.
\end{proof}

\smallskip
\noindent
We immediately have the following corollary.
\begin{cor}\label{c1}
Let $\delta_1, \delta_2,\ldots, \delta_l$ be a full irreducible C-chain in $k^{[2]}$. Then there exists a chain of automorphisms $\alpha_2=\mathrm{id},\beta_2,\ldots, \alpha_l$ such that $\beta_i=\tau_i\circ\alpha_i$, $\alpha_{i+1}=\gamma_i\circ\beta_i$, where $\gamma_i\in\mathrm{Af}_2(k)$, $\tau_i\in\mathrm{T}_2(k)$, and  $\alpha_{i},\beta_{i}\in \Psi(\delta_i)$, for each $i \in \{1, \dots ,l\}$.
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
We have $\alpha_2=\mathrm{id}\in\Psi(\frac{\partial}{\partial y})=\Psi(\delta_1)$. 
%Suppose we have $\alpha_{1}=\mathrm{id},\beta_1,\alpha_2,\beta_2,\ldots,\alpha_k$ satisfying conditions of the corollary. In particular, $\alpha_k\in\Psi(\partial_k)$. 
For each $i$, by Lemma~\ref{pl}, there exist $\beta_i\in \Psi(\delta_i)$ and $\gamma_i\in \mathrm{Af}_2(k)$ such that $\alpha_{i+1}:=\gamma_i\circ\beta_i\in \Psi(\delta_{i+1})$. Since $\alpha_{i}, \beta_{i}\in \Psi(\delta_i)=\mathrm{T}_2(k)\alpha_i$, we have $\beta_i=\tau_i\circ\alpha_i$, where $\tau_i\in \mathrm{T}_2(k)$.
\end{proof}

\smallskip
\noindent
Next we define the level of an LND.
\begin{defn}
{\em Let $\delta$ be an irreducible LND of $k[x,y]$. Assume $\delta_1, \delta_2,\ldots, \delta_l=\delta$ is a full irreducible C-chain with minimal possible $l$. Let us define the {\it level} of $\delta$ to be this integer $l$ and denote it by $\mathrm{lev}(\delta)_{(x,y)}$. 
}
\end{defn}

\begin{rem}
{\em The definition of level depends on the coordinate system chosen for $k^{[2]}$. Indeed, for an irreducible $\delta \in {\rm LND}(k^{[2]})$, there exist $f,g \in k^{[2]}$ such that $k[x,y]=k[f,g]$ and $\delta=\dfrac{\partial }{\partial f}$. Then $\mathrm{lev}(\delta)_{(f,g)}=1$. So for any irreducible LND of $k^{[2]}$, there exists a coordinate system of $k^{[2]}$ with respect to which the level is one.
}
\end{rem}

\begin{rem}\label{rr11}
{\em Let $\varphi\in\Psi(\delta)$. Assume $\delta \notin \Big [\dfrac{\partial}{\partial x}\Big ] \cup \Big[\dfrac{\partial}{\partial y}\Big ]$. Then Corollary~\ref{c1} implies that 
$\mathrm{lev}(\delta)_{(x,y)}=m+2$, where $m$ is the number of affine automorphisms in the shortest decomposition 
$$\varphi=\tau_m\circ\gamma_m\ldots\circ\tau_1\circ\gamma_1,$$ 
where each $\gamma_i \in {\rm Af}_2(k)$ and $\tau_i \in {\rm T}_2(k)$ ($1 \leqslant i \leqslant m$). By Theorem~\ref{jvk}, the condition that this decomposition is shortest is equivalent to saying that $\gamma_i\notin \mathrm{T}_2(k)$, $1\leqslant i\leqslant m$ and $\tau_j\notin \mathrm{Af}_2(k)$, $1\leqslant j\leqslant m-1$. Note that, each $\gamma_i$ can be decomposed as $\gamma_i=\tau'\circ\theta\circ\tau''$, where $\tau', \tau''\in \mathrm{T}_2(k)$ and $\theta$ is the swapping
$$
\theta\colon
\begin{pmatrix}
x\\
y
\end{pmatrix}
\mapsto
\begin{pmatrix}
y\\
x
\end{pmatrix}.
$$  Therefore, we can say that $\mathrm{lev}(\delta)_{(x,y)}=m+2$, where $m$ is the number of swappings in the shortest decomposition 
$\varphi=\tau_m\circ\theta\ldots\circ\tau_1\circ\theta\circ\tau_0$. 
}
\end{rem}


\smallskip
\noindent
The next proposition shows that given an irreducible $\delta \in {\rm LND}(k^{[2]})$ with level $l$ with respect to a fixed coordinate system, the LNDs in a full irreducible minimal C-chain are unique up to multiplication by scalars.
\begin{prop}
Let $\delta$ be an irreducible LND of $k[x,y]$ with $\mathrm{lev}(\delta)_{(x,y)}=l$. Assume 
$$\delta_1, \delta_2,\ldots, \delta_l=\delta\  \text{ and }\ \rho_1, \rho_2,\ldots, \rho_l=\delta$$ 
are two full irreducible minimal C-chains with length $l$ . Then for each $i \in \{1, \dots ,l\}$, we have $\rho_i=\lambda_i\delta_i$ for some non-zero $\lambda_i\in k$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
From two full irreducible minimal C-chains, by Corollary \ref{c1}, we obtain two sequences of automorphisms: $\alpha_{1}=\mathrm{id},\beta_1,\alpha_2,\beta_2,\ldots, \alpha_l$ and $\alpha'_{1}=\mathrm{id},\beta'_1,\alpha'_2,\beta'_2,\ldots, \alpha'_l$. By construction, we have $\alpha_l,\alpha'_l\in \Psi(\delta)$. Hence, $\alpha_l'\in \mathrm{T}_2(k)\alpha_l$. So there exists $\omega\in\mathrm{T}_2(k)$ such that $\alpha'_l=\omega\circ \alpha_l$. Note that, $\beta_i=\tau_i\circ\alpha_i$ and $\alpha_{i+1}=\gamma_i\circ\beta_i$, where $\gamma_i\in\mathrm{Af}_2(k)$, $\tau_i\in\mathrm{T}_2(k)$. Similarly, $\beta'_i=\tau'_i\circ\alpha'_i$, $\alpha'_{i+1}=\gamma'_i\circ\beta'_i$, where $\gamma'_i\in\mathrm{Af}_2(k)$, $\tau'_i\in\mathrm{T}_2(k)$. So, we obtain
$$
\gamma'_{l-1}\circ\tau'_{l-1}\circ\ldots\circ\gamma'_1\circ\tau'_1=\alpha'_l=\omega\circ \alpha_l=\omega \circ \gamma_{l-1}\circ\tau_{l-1}\circ\ldots\circ\gamma_1\circ\tau_1.
$$

Since $l$ is minimal possible, we have $\gamma_{i}, \gamma'_{i}\notin \mathrm{T}_2(k)$ and $\tau_j,\tau'_j\notin\mathrm{Af}_2(k)$. By Theorem~\ref{jvk}, we then have $\alpha'_j=\eta_j\circ\alpha_j$ for each $j \in \{1, \dots ,l\}$, where $\eta_j\in\mathrm{T}_2(k)\cap \mathrm{Af}_2(k)$. Therefore, $\Psi^{-1}(\alpha_j)=\Psi^{-1}(\alpha'_j)$. Since $\alpha_j \in \Psi(\delta_j)$, $\alpha'_j \in \Psi(\rho_j)$ and ${\rm T}_2(k)\alpha_j={\rm T}_2(k)\alpha'_j$, by Lemma \ref{bij}, we are done. 
\end{proof}





\subsection{LNDs of rank at most $2$}
This subsection shows that one can apply the C-construction to construct LNDs of $k^{[n]}$ of rank at most $2$. Let $B=k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ and $D \in {\rm LND}(B)$ such that ${\rm rk}~D \leqslant 2$. We can choose a system of variables such that $k[x_3,\ldots,x_n]\subseteq \mathrm{Ker}\,D$. Then we can obtain $D$ from partial derivations by a construction similar to the C-construction.

\smallskip
\noindent
\begin{lem}\label{CLNDC3var1}
Let $R$ be an affine $k$-domain with field of fractions $K$ and $D$ an irreducible $R$-LND of $R[x_1,x_2](=R^{[2]})$. Then there exists a chain of irreducible LNDs of $R[x_1,x_2]$  
$$ \partial_1:=\dfrac{\partial }{\partial x_1}, \partial_2 :=\dfrac{\partial }{\partial x_2}, \partial _3, \dots , \partial_l=D,$$ 
such that for all $i$, $1 \leqslant i \leqslant l$, $\delta_i(R)=0$ and 
$$h_i\partial_i=\sigma \partial_{i-1}+f_i\partial_{i-1}$$ 
for some $\sigma\in {\rm Ker}~\partial_{i-1}$, $f_i,h_i\in R$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
Since $D(R)=0$, it induces an LND $\delta$ of $K[x_1,x_2]$. Since $D$ is irreducible in $R[x_1,x_2]$, so is $\delta$ in $K[x_1,x_2]$. By Proposition \ref{CLNDC2var}, $\delta$ can be constructed by a full irreducible C-chain $\{\delta_i\}_{i=1}^l$ in $K[x_1,x_2]$ starting from $\delta_1=\dfrac{\partial }{\partial x_1}$ and $\delta_2=\dfrac{\partial }{\partial x_2}$. For each $i$, there exists $g_i \in K$ such that $\partial_i=g_i\delta_i$ is an irreducible LND of $R[x_1,x_2]$. Note that $\partial_{i-2}$ and $\partial_i$ commutes with~$\partial_{i-1}$. By Corollary~\ref{corrin}, we have $h_i\partial_i=\sigma \partial_{i-1}+f_i\partial_{i-1}$ for some $\sigma\in \mathrm{Ker}\,\partial_{i-1}$, $f_i,h_i\in R$.
\end{proof}

\smallskip
\noindent
We immediately have the following corollary.
\begin{cor}\label{CLNDC3var} Let $D \in {\rm LND}(k[x_1,\ldots,x_n])$ be irreducible and $D(x_3)=\ldots=D(x_n)=0$. Then there exists a chain of irreducible LNDs of 
$k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ 
$$ \partial_1:=\dfrac{\partial }{\partial x_1}, \partial_2 :=\dfrac{\partial }{\partial x_2}, \partial _3, \dots , \partial_l=D,$$ 
such that for all $i$, $1 \leqslant i \leqslant l$, we have $\partial_i(x_3)=\ldots=\partial_i(x_n)=0$ and 
$$h_i\partial_i=\sigma \partial_{i-1}+f_i\partial_{i-1}$$ 
for some $\sigma\in \mathrm{Ker}\,\partial_{i-1}$, $f_i,h_i\in k[x_3,\ldots,x_n]$.
\end{cor}

\begin{proof} The proof follows from Lemma \ref{CLNDC3var1} by setting $R=k[x_3, \dots , x_n]$.
\end{proof}

We call this construction a {\it Modified C-construction} (denoted by {\it MC-construction}) and the chain $\partial_1,\ldots, \partial_l$ a {\it full irreducible MC-chain}.
Like in the case of $k^{[2]}$, one can define the level of an irreducible LND $D$ of rank at most $2$, as the length of the shortest full irreducible MC-chain ending at $D$. 
As noted earlier, this level depends on the chosen coordinate system. We denote it by $\mathrm{lev}_{\mathbf{x}}(D)$, where $\mathbf{x}=\{x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n\}$. 
This motivates us to make the following definition. Suppose $D$ is an LND of $k^{[n]}$ with rank at most $2$. Let $\Gamma_D$ denote the collection of all coordinate systems $\mathbf{y}=\{y_1,\ldots,y_n\}$  of $k^{[n]}$ such that $D(y_i)=0$ for $i\geqslant 3$. We would like  to define the universal level as minimal possible level among all such coordinate systems~$\mathbf{y}$.
 
\begin{defn}
{\em For an irreducible $D \in {\rm LND}(k^{[n]})$ of rank at most $2$, we define the {\it universal level} of $D$, denoted by $\mathrm{ulev}(D)$ as 
$$\mathrm{ulev}(D)=\min_{\mathbf{y} \in \Gamma_D}~\left\{ \mathrm{lev}_{\mathbf{y}}(D)~\vert ~ \mathbf{y} \in \Gamma_D \right\}.$$
}
\end{defn}

\smallskip
\noindent
It easy to see that $\mathrm{ulev}(D)$ does not attain the value $2$. Using universal level, one can characterize rank $1$ LNDs and triangularizable LNDs of $k^{[n]}$. 
\begin{thm}\label{crtr} Let $D \in {\rm LND}(k^{[n]})$ be irreducible of $rank$ at most $2$. Then the following statements hold:
\begin{enumerate}
\item [\rm (i)] $\mathrm{ulev}(D)=1 \Leftrightarrow rk\,D=1$; 
\item [\rm (ii)] $\mathrm{ulev}(D)= 3 \Leftrightarrow D~\text{is triangularizable LND of rank 2}.$
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

\begin{proof} (i) Suppose $\mathrm{ulev}(D) =1$. Then there exists a coordinate system $\{y_1,\ldots,y_n\}$ of $k^{[n]}$ such that $D=\dfrac{\partial }{\partial y_1}$. Hence, $\mathrm{rk}\,D=1$. Conversely, since $D$ is irreducible of rank $1$, there exists a coordinate system of $k^{[n]}$ in which $D$ is a partial derivation. Hence, $\mathrm{ulev}(D)=1$.

\smallskip
\noindent
(ii) The condition $\mathrm{ulev}(D)=3$ is equivalent to the fact that there exists a coordinate system $\{y_1,\ldots,y_n\}$ of~$k^{[n]}$ such that 
$$h(y_3,\ldots,y_n)D=f(y_3,\ldots,y_n)\dfrac{\partial }{\partial y_1}+\sigma(y_1,y_3,y_4,\ldots,y_n)\dfrac{\partial }{\partial y_2},$$
for some $f \in k[y_3, \ldots , y_n]$ and $\sigma \in {\rm Ker}~\dfrac{\partial}{\partial x_2}=k[y_1, y_3, \ldots ,y_n]$. 
Swapping $y_1$ and $y_2$ we obtain
$$h(y_3,\ldots,y_n)D=f(y_3,\ldots,y_n)\dfrac{\partial }{\partial y_2}+\sigma(y_2,y_3,y_4,\ldots,y_n)\dfrac{\partial }{\partial y_1}.$$ 
So, $D(y_1)=  \dfrac{\sigma(y_2,\ldots,y_n)}{h(y_3,\ldots,y_n)}$ and $D(y_2)= \dfrac{f(y_3,\ldots,y_n)}{h(y_3,\ldots,y_n)}$. Since $D(y_1), D(y_2) \in k^{[n]}$, it follows that $D(y_1) \in k[y_2, \ldots , y_n]$ and $D(y_2) \in k[y_3, \ldots ,y_n]$. Clearly, \mbox{$D(y_3)=\ldots=D(y_n)=0$.} This implies triangularizability of $D$ and since ${\rm ulev}(D) \neq 1$, we must have ${\rm rk}~D=2$ by part (i).

\smallskip
\noindent
Conversely, if $D$ is triangularizable of rank $2$, then in some coordinate system $\{y_1,\ldots,y_n\}$, we have 
$$D(y_3)=\ldots=D(y_n)=0,\qquad D(y_2)=f(y_3,\ldots,y_n),\qquad D(y_1)=h(y_2,\ldots,y_n), $$ for suitable non-zero $f$ and $h$.  Then
$$
D=h(y_2,\ldots,y_n)\frac{\partial}{\partial y_1}+f(y_3,\ldots,y_n)\frac{\partial}{\partial y_2}.
$$
So $\frac{\partial}{\partial y_2}, \frac{\partial}{\partial y_1}, D$ is an irreducible MC-chain. Hence $\mathrm{ulev}(D)\leqslant 3$. But by (i), $\mathrm{ulev}(D)\neq 1$. Since universal level never equals 2, we have $\mathrm{ulev}(D)=3$.
\end{proof}

\begin{rem}\label{ulev}
{\em Since there are irreducible LNDs on $k^{[3]}$ with universal level $1$ or $3$, it is natural to ask whether for an irreducible $D \in {\rm LND}(k^{[3]})$, can ${\rm ulev}(D) > 3 ?$ In Section \ref{rk2sec}, we give an example of an LND on $k[x,y,z]$ with universal level $4$ (see Example \ref{ex1}). But we don't have any example of an LND for which we can prove that the universal level is $5$ or more. So we end this section with the following question.

We have an explicit candidate of an LND $D$ of $k^{[3]}$ with $\mathrm{ulev}(D)=5$, see Remark~\ref{varema} and Question~\ref{qq}. 
If we are given an LND $D$ of $k[x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n]$ with $D(x_3)=\ldots=D(x_n)=0$, we can consider its extension $\delta$ to $k(x_3,\ldots, x_n)[x_1,x_2]$ and  take $\alpha\in \Psi(\delta)$. This automorphism $\alpha$ can be algorithmically decomposed onto a composition of triangular and affine ones. 
This gives us an algorithm for computing $\mathrm{lev}_{(x_1,\ldots, x_n)}D$. This leads to the following question.
\begin{que}\label{ququ}
Is there an algorithm to compute the universal level of a given irreducible LND of $k^{[n]}$ of rank at most $2$, where $n \geqslant 3$?

\section{Rank $\mathbf{2}$ derivations}\label{rk2sec}
In this section, we study locally nilpotent derivations of $B=k^{[3]}$. We first give a necessary and sufficient condition for a locally nilpotent derivation to have a non-equivalent commuting locally nilpotent derivation. 

\begin{prop}\label{rk2com1}
Let $B=k^{[3]}$ and $D (\neq 0) \in {\rm LND}(B)$. Then there exists $E (\neq 0) \in {\rm LND}(B)$ such that $DE=ED$ and ${\rm Ker}~D \neq {\rm Ker}~E$ if and only if there exits $g \in B$ such that $D(g)=f(x) \in k[x]$ and $x$ is a variable of ${\rm Ker}~D$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof} Suppose $DE=ED$ and ${\rm Ker}~D \neq {\rm Ker}~E$. Then, by Proposition \ref{frcom}, there exists a variable $x$ of $B$ such that ${\rm Ker}~D \cap {\rm Ker}~E=k[x]$. By Lemma \ref{dtriang}(i), $x$ is a variable of ${\rm Ker}~D$. Since $DE=ED$ and ${\rm Ker}~D \neq {\rm Ker}~E$, $D$ restricts to $\delta (\neq 0) \in {\rm LND}({\rm Ker}~E)$. Since~$\delta$ is non-zero, it has a local slice $g$. Then $D(g)=\delta (g) \in {\rm Ker}~\delta=k[x]$.

\smallskip
\noindent
Conversely, suppose that there exists $g \in B$ such that $D(g)=f(x) \in k[x]$ and $x$ is a variable in ${\rm Ker}~D$. Then, by Lemma \ref{dtriang}(ii), $x$ is a variable in $B$ such that $D(x)=0$. Let $B=k[x,y,z]$ and consider the derivation $$E:={\rm Jac}(x,g,\cdot)=\dfrac{\partial g}{\partial y}\dfrac{\partial}{\partial z}-\dfrac{\partial g}{\partial z}\dfrac{\partial}{\partial y}.$$
Let ${\rm Ker}~D=k[x,p]$ for some $p \in B$. By Theorem \ref{df}, we have
$$D=h~{\rm Jac}(x,p,.)=h\left(\dfrac{\partial p}{\partial y}\dfrac{\partial}{\partial z}-\dfrac{\partial p}{\partial z}\dfrac{\partial}{\partial y}\right),~\text{where}~h \in k[x,p]\setminus \{0\}.$$ Since $D(g)=f(x) \in k[x]$, we have $h \mid f(x)$. So we also have $h=h(x) \in k[x]$. Note that  
$$h(x)E(p)=h(x)\left(\dfrac{\partial g}{\partial y}\dfrac{\partial p}{\partial z}-\dfrac{\partial g}{\partial z}\dfrac{\partial p}{\partial y}\right)=-D(g)=-f(x).$$ Hence $E^2(p)=0$. Since $g$ is a local slice of $D$, we have $k[x,y,z,\frac{1}{f(x)}]=k[x,p,\frac{1}{f(x)}][g]$. So any element $s \in B$ can be represented as 
$$s=\dfrac{f_s(x,p,g)}{f^{m_s}},~\text{where}~f_s \in k[x,p,g]~\text{and}~m_s \in \bN \cup \{0\}.$$
Since $E(x)=E(g)=E^2(p)=0$, we obtain $E \in {\rm LND}(B)$. Now we have 
$$ED(x)=DE(x)=0, \qquad ED(g)=E(f(x))=0=DE(g),$$
$$h(x)DE(p)=D(h(x)E(p))=D(-f(x))=0=h(x)ED(p).$$ Since $D$ and $E$ commute on $k[x,p,g]$ and $D(x)=E(x)=0$, they also commute on $B$ because of $B[\frac{1}{f(x)}]=k[x,p,g,\frac{1}{f(x)}].$
\end{proof}

\smallskip
\noindent
\begin{rem}{\em The above proof is similar to the proof given in \cite[Lemma 4.1]{KH1}. The authors prove the existence of a locally nilpotent derivation commuting with $D$, under the hypothesis that $D$ is {\it irreducible of $rank~2$}. The condition that ``{\it there exists $g \in B$ such that $D(g)=f(x) \in k[x]$ and $x$ is a variable in ${\rm Ker}\,D$}'' is automatically satisfied if $g$ is a minimal local slice of $D$ \cite[Lemma 2.5, Theorem 3.1]{KH1} under the assumption that $\rm{rk}~D \neq 1$. Our result holds true for any locally nilpotent derivation of $B$ of $\rm{rank}$ at most $2$ without any assumption on irreducibility.
}
\end{rem}

\smallskip
\noindent
We next claim an elementary lemma.
\begin{lem}\label{rk2lem}
Let $B=k^{[3]}$ and $D \in {\rm LND}(B)$ be irreducible of rank at most 2. Then there exists a variable $x$ of $B$ and $g \in B$ such that $D(g)=f(x) \in {\rm Ker}~D$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof} Since $\mathrm{rk}\,D \leqslant 2$, there exists a variable $x$ of $B$ such that $x \in {\rm Ker}~D$. Then $D$ extends to an irreducible locally nilpotent derivation $\tilde{D}$ on $k(x)[y,z]$. By Theorem \ref{R}, $\tilde{D}$ has a slice, i.e., there exist $g \in B$ and $f \in k[x]\setminus \{0\}$ such that $\tilde{D}(\frac{g}{f})=1$. Hence $D(g)=f(x)$.
\end{proof}

\smallskip
\noindent
We immediately have the following corollary.
\begin{cor}\label{var}
Let $B=k[x,y,z]$, $D \in {\rm LND}(B)$ be of rank~2 and $A:={\rm Ker}~D$. Let $x \in A$ and  $x^{\prime} \in A$ be any other variable of $B$, then there exist $\lambda \in k^*$ and $\mu \in k$ such that $x^{\prime}=\lambda x + \mu$.
\end{cor}

\begin{proof} Without loss of generality we may assume $D$ to be irreducible. By Lemma \ref{rk2lem}, there exist $g, g^{\prime} \in B$ such that $D(g)=f(x)$ and $D(g^{\prime})=h(x^{\prime})$ for some $f \in k[x]$ and $h \in k[x^{\prime}]$. By Theorem \ref{pl}, there exists $v \in A$ such that $A \cap DB=(v)$. Then $v \mid f$ and $v \mid h$. So there exists $a(x) \in k[x]$ and $b(x^{\prime}) \in k[x^{\prime}]$ such that $v=a(x)=b(x^{\prime})$. Since $\rm{rk}~D \neq 1$, $v \notin k$. So $x$ and $x^{\prime}$ are algebraically dependent over $k$. Since $k[x]$ is algebraically closed in $B$, we have $x^{\prime} \in k[x]$. But $x^{\prime}$ is a variable of $B$ and hence has to be a linear polynomial in $x$. Thus there exist $\lambda \in k^*$ and $\mu \in k$ such that $x^{\prime}=\lambda x + \mu$.
\end{proof}

\smallskip
Let us now describe all LNDs of $B$ commuting with a fixed non-zero irreducible LND $D$.
\begin{thm}\label{rk2thm1} Let $D \in {\rm LND}(B)$ be irreducible. Then the following statements hold:
\begin{enumerate}
\item [\rm (i)] if $\mathrm{rk}\,D=3$, then all LNDs commuting with $D$ are equivalent to $D$;

\item [\rm (ii)] if $\mathrm{rk}\,D=2$, fix such  a variable $x$ of $B$ that $x\in A=\mathrm{Ker}\,D$. Then there exists $E \in {\rm LND}(B)$, non-equivalent to $D$  such that $DE=ED$ and for any $E^{\prime} \in {\rm LND}(B)$ be such that $DE^{\prime}=E^{\prime}D$, there exist $\alpha_1,\alpha_2, \in k[x]$ and $\beta \in {\rm Ker}~D$ such that $$\alpha_1E^{\prime}=\alpha_2E+\beta D.$$ Moreover ${\rm Ker}\,D \cap {\rm Ker}\,E= {\rm Ker}\,D\cap {\rm Ker}\,E^{\prime}=k[x]$;

\item [\rm (iii)] if $\mathrm{rk}\,D=1$,  then for each variable $x$ of $A$ there exists $E \in {\rm LND}(B)$ non-equivalent to $D$ such that $DE=ED$, ${\rm Ker}\,D \cap {\rm Ker}\,E=k[x]$ and there exists a systen of coordinates $\{x,y,z\}$ in $B$ such that $E$ is triangular with respect to this system. If $E^{\prime} \in {\rm LND}(B)$ be such that $DE^{\prime}=E^{\prime}D$ and ${\rm Ker}\,D \cap {\rm Ker}\,E^{\prime}=k[x]$, then $E^{\prime}$ is triangular with respect to $\{x,y,z\}$ and there exist $\alpha_1,\alpha_2, \in k[x]$ and $\beta \in {\rm Ker}~D$ such that $$\alpha_1E^{\prime}=\alpha_2E+\beta D.$$

\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

\begin{proof} Since $D$ is irreducible, if there is a non-equivalent $E$ such that $DE=ED$, then by Proposition~\ref{rk2com1}, we can choose $g \in B$ such that $D(g) \in k[x]$, where $x$ is a variable of $B$ contained in ${\rm Ker}~D$. This proves (i).

If ${\rm rk}~D=2$, then such an $E$ exists by Lemma~\ref{rk2lem} and Proposition~\ref{rk2com1}. By Proposition~\ref{frcom}, $\mathrm{Ker}\,D\cap\mathrm{Ker}\,E=k[f]$, where $f$ is a variable of $B$. By Corollary~\ref{var}, $k[f]=k[x]$. We can say the same about $E^{\prime}$. Therefore, $D,E$ and $E^{\prime}$ are $k[x]$-LNDs of $B$. So, we can apply Corollary~\ref{corrin}, which proves (ii). 

If $\mathrm{rk}\,D=1$, then there a coordinate system $(x,y,z)$ of $B$ such that $D=\frac{\partial}{\partial z}$ and $A=k[x,y]$. Clearly, such an $E$ exists by Lemma~\ref{rk2lem} and Proposition~\ref{rk2com1}. As $ED=DE$, $E$ restricts to an LND on $A$. Since $E(x)=0$, by Proposition \ref{frext}, $E(y) \in k[x]$. Again by Proposition \ref{frext}, $E(z) \in A=k[x,y]$. So $E$ is triangular with respect to the coordinate system $(x,y,z)$. Similar argument shows that $E^{\prime}$ is also triangular and the rest of the proof follows from Corollary \ref{corrin}.

% $A\cong k^{[2]}$. Let $x$ be a variable of $A$. Then , in some coordinates $B=k[x,y,z]$ and $D=\frac{\partial}{\partial z}$. We can take $E$ such that $DE=ED$ and ${\rm Ker}\,D \cap {\rm Ker}\,E=k[x]$. For example $E=\frac{\partial}{\partial y}$. If $E^{\prime} \in {\rm LND}(B)$ be such that $DE^{\prime}=E^{\prime}D$ and ${\rm Ker}\,D \cap {\rm Ker}\,E^{\prime}=k[x]$, then $D,E$ and $E^{\prime}$ are $k[x]$-LNDs of $B$. Applying Corollary~\ref{corrin}, we prove (iii). 
\end{proof}








Let us now apply the theory of Section~\ref{cln} to investigate LNDs of rank $2$ of $B=k^{[3]}$. 

\begin{prop}\label{stper}
Let $D$ be an irreducible LND of $B=k^{[3]}$ of rank at most $2$. Suppose $B=k[x,y,z]$ and $x\in A=\mathrm{Ker}\,D$. Let $\mathbf{x}=\{x,y,z\}$ and let $\Gamma$ denote the collection of all coordinate systems $\mathbf{x^{\prime}}=\{x,y^{\prime}, z^{\prime}\}$, where $y^{\prime}, z^{\prime} \in B$.
Then
$$\mathrm{ulev}(D)=\min_{\mathbf{x^{\prime}} \in \Gamma}~\left\{ \mathrm{lev}_{\mathbf{x^{\prime}}}(D)~\vert ~ \mathbf{x^{\prime}} \in \Gamma \right\}.$$
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Since $A$ contains a variable $x$ of $B$, the rank of $D$ is at most $2$.
By Corollary~\ref{CLNDC3var},~$D$ can be obtained by a full MC-chain $\frac{\partial}{\partial y}, \frac{\partial}{\partial y},\ldots, D$.  By definition, universal level of $D$ is the minimal level of D with respect to a coordinate system $\{x',y',z'\}$ with $x'\in A$. If $\mathrm{rk}\,D=2$, Corollary~\ref{var} implies $x'=\lambda x+\mu$. So, $\{x,y',z'\}$ is also a system of coordinates and since $k(x')=k(x)$, $\mathrm{lev}_{(x',y',z')}(D)=\mathrm{lev}_{(x,y',z')}(D)$. So, to compute $\mathrm{ulev}\,(D)$ we need to take minimal $\mathrm{lev}_{(x,y',z')}(D)$. If $\mathrm{rk}~D=1$ and $D$ is irreducible, then by Proposition~\ref{fr95c}, $D$ has a slice, say $s$. By Theorem \ref{df}, $A=k[x,f]$, for some $f \in B$. Then, by Theorem \ref{st}, $B=k[x,f,s]$ and $D=\dfrac{\partial}{\partial s}$. Therefore, $\mathrm{lev}_{(x,f,s)}(D)=1$. So, in this case too, $\mathrm{ulev}(D)=\min_{\mathbf{x^{\prime}} \in \Pi}~\left\{ \mathrm{lev}_{\mathbf{x^{\prime}}}(D)~\vert ~ \mathbf{x^{\prime}} \in \Gamma \right\}$.
\end{proof}


\smallskip
\indent
As before, let $D \in {\rm LND}(B)$ be irreducible of rank at most $2$. Let us also fix a coordinate system $\{x,y,z\}$ of $B$ such that $D(x)=0$. Let $\alpha$ be a $k(x)$-automorphism of $k(x)[y,z]$. By~$\theta$, we denote the swapping 
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
y\\
z
\end{pmatrix}\mapsto
\begin{pmatrix}
z\\
y
\end{pmatrix}

\begin{defn}
{\em 
Let us define the {\it complexity of $\alpha$}, denoted by $c(\alpha)$ to be the minimal number~$m$ such that there exist $\tau_0,\tau_1\ldots, \tau_m\in \mathrm{T}_2(k(x))$ with the property that 
$$
\tau_m\circ\theta\circ\tau_{m-1}\circ\ldots\circ\theta\circ\tau_{0}\circ\alpha \in \mathrm{Aut}(k[x,y,z]).

\end{defn}
\begin{rem}
{\em

$$
\eta_N\circ\theta\circ\eta_{N-1}\circ\ldots\circ\theta\circ\eta_{0}\circ\alpha =\mathrm{id}.

\smallskip
\noindent
Let us consider the extension of $D$ as an LND of $k(x)[y,z]$, which we also denote by $D$ and take $\Psi(D)$ as in Section~\ref{sectwovar}.
\begin{thm}\label{comulev}
Suppose $D$ is an irreducible LND of rank 2. Then 
$${\rm ulev}(D)=c(\alpha)+2,~~\text{where}~~\alpha\in\Psi(D).$$
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
 Let us recall that $\alpha\in\Psi(D)$ takes $y$ to a generator of $\mathrm{Ker}\,D$ and $z$ to a slice of $D$. Since the mapping $\Psi$ depends on the coordinate system, let us write $\alpha \in\Psi_{(x,y,z)}(D)$.
If we take another coordinate system $\{x,y',z'\}$, then we can consider the automorphism $\varphi$ of $B$ given by $(x,y',z')\mapsto(x,y,z)$. In this system of variables we also can consider $\Psi_{(x,y',z')}(D)$. It is easy to see that $\alpha\circ \varphi\in \Psi_{(x,y',z')}(D)$. Let us also recall that $\mathrm{lev}_{(x,y,z)}(D)=m+2$, where $m$ is the number of affine automorphisms in the decomposition of $\alpha=\tau_m\circ\gamma_m\ldots\circ\tau_1\circ\gamma_1$, $\tau_i\in \mathrm{T}_2(k(x))$, $\gamma_i\in\mathrm{Af}_2(k(x))$ ($1 \leqslant i \leqslant m$), see~Remark~\ref{rr11}. Equivalently, $\mathrm{lev}_{(x,y,z)}(D)=m+2$, where $m$ is the number of swappings  $\theta$ in the decomposition $\alpha=\tau_m\circ\theta\ldots\circ\tau_1\circ\theta\circ\tau_0$, $\tau_j\in \mathrm{T}_2(k(x))$ ($0 \leqslant j \leqslant m$). By Proposition~\ref{stper}, ${\rm ulev}(D)$ is the minimal $\mathrm{lev}_{(x,y^{\prime},z^{\prime})}(D)$, where $k[x,y,z]=k[x,y^{\prime},z^{\prime}]$. It follows from the definition, that $c(\alpha)=c(\alpha \circ \varphi)$ for any $\varphi \in {\rm Aut}(B)$. Thus if we take $m$ to be the minimal number of swappings $\theta$ in the decomposition of $\alpha \circ  \varphi$ for all $\varphi\in \mathrm{Aut}(B)$, such that $\varphi(x)=x$, then ${\rm ulev}(D)=m+2$. The result follows.
\end{proof}

The following corollary gives a criterion for an irreducible LND of rank at most $2$ to be triangularizable.
\begin{cor}\label{ustr}
Let $D$ be an irreducible LND of $k[x,y,z]$ such that $D(x)=0$. Consider $\alpha\in\Psi(D)$. Then $$D~\text{ is triangularizable}~\Leftrightarrow ~c (\alpha) \leqslant 1.$$
Moreover, if $D$ is triangularizable, then there exist $u_1,v_0 \in k(x)$, $f,g \in k[x,y,z]$, $F_0 \in k(x)^{[1]}$ and $\zeta \in {\rm Aut}(k[x,y,z])$ such that 
$$\zeta(y)=u_1(v_0g+F_0(f)).$$ 
\end{cor}

\begin{proof} The proof follows from Theorem~\ref{crtr}, Theorem~\ref{comulev} and Remark~\ref{comr1}. More explicitly,~$D$ is triangularizable if and only if there exists a decomposition
$$\varphi=\tau_1\circ\theta\circ\tau_0\circ\alpha, $$ 
where $\varphi \in {\rm Aut}(k[x,y,z])$ and $\tau_0,\tau_1 \in {\rm T}_2(k(x))$.
Denote $\alpha(y)=f(y,z)$, $\alpha(z)=g(y,z)$, where $f,g\in k(x)[y,z]$. Let 
$$\tau_0\colon
\begin{pmatrix}
y\\
z
\end{pmatrix}
\rightarrow
\begin{pmatrix}
u_0y\\
v_0z+F_0(y)
\end{pmatrix}, \qquad
\tau_1\colon
\begin{pmatrix}
y\\
z
\end{pmatrix}
\rightarrow
\begin{pmatrix}
u_1y\\
v_1z+F_1(y)
\end{pmatrix}.
$$
Here $u_i,v_i\in k(x)$, $F_i\in k(x)^{[1]}$ for $i=0,1$.
Then
$$
\tau_1\circ\theta\circ\tau_0\circ\alpha\colon
\begin{pmatrix}
y\\
z
\end{pmatrix}
\rightarrow
\begin{pmatrix}
u_1(v_0g+F_0(f))\\
v_1u_0f+F_1\left(v_0g+F_0(f)\right)
\end{pmatrix}.
$$
If $D$ is triangularizable, then there exists an $k[x]$-automorphism of $k[x,y,z]$ of this form. By suitably choosing $u_1$ and $v_0$, one can further assume $f,g \in k[x,y,z]$ in the expression $u_1(v_0g+F_0(f))$.
\end{proof}

\smallskip
\indent
It turns out that in many cases, the polynomial 
$u_1(v_0g+F_0(f))$ cannot be the image of~$y$ under any $k[x]$-automorphism of $k[x,y,z]$. Let us fix two non-negative integers $p$ and~$q$ not both zero. Let us consider the $\mathbb{Z}$-grading on $k(x)[y,z]$ given by 
$\deg y=p$,  $\deg z=q$. If $h\in k(x)[y,z]$, we denote by $\overline{h}$ the sum of terms with the biggest degree with respect to this grading. Since $\overline{h}$ is homogeneous, by $\deg(\overline{h})$, we mean the degree of any its terms. We denote the sum of linear terms of $h$ by $L(h)$.

\begin{defn}
{\em
Let $h\in k[x,y,z]$. Denote the greatest common divisor of all coefficients in $k[x]$  of this polynomial, considered as polynomial in $y$ and $z$, by $d(h)$. We say that a polynomial $h$ is {\it primitive} if $d(h)=1$. 
}
\end{defn}

\begin{prop}\label{usnap} Let $f,g\in k[x,y,z]$. Suppose, $\gcd(d(L(f)),d(L(g)))=r \in k[x] \setminus k$. Let~$g$ be a primitive polynomial such that $g(x,0,0)=0$. Assume there exist $p$ and $q$ such that  $\overline{f}$ is primitive and 
$\deg(\overline{f})>\deg(\overline{g})$. Then there does not exist any $k[x]$-automorphism $\zeta$ of $k[x,y,z]$, such that  $\zeta(y)=u_1(v_0g+F_0(f))$ for any $u_1,v_0\in k(x)$ and $F_0\in k(x)[t]=k(x)^{[1]}$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof} Suppose that, $\zeta$ is a $k[x]$-automorphism of $k[x,y,z]$, such that  $\zeta(y)=u_1(v_0g+F_0(f))$ for some $u_1,v_0\in k(x)$ and $F_0\in k(x)[t]$. Denote
$$u_1F_0[t]=a_nt^n+\ldots +a_0, \qquad \text{where}~a_i\in k(x), ~0 \leqslant i \leqslant n.$$
Let us show that $a_i\in k[x]$ for all $i\geqslant 0$. Define $$m :=max ~\{i ~\vert ~ a_i \notin k[x]\}.$$ Then terms of degree $m\deg(\overline{f})$ in $\zeta(y)$ coincide with terms of degree $m\deg(\overline{f})$ in $u_1F_0(f)$. Since for all $j > m$, $a_j \in k[x]$ and $\overline{f}$ is primitive, sum of terms of degree $m\deg(\overline{f})$ in $u_1F_0(f)$ does not lie in $k[x,y,z]$. Therefore, all $a_i$ are in $k[x]$. So  $u_1v_0g$ in $k[x,y,z]$. Since $g$ is primitive, $u_1v_0\in k[x]$. Hence, $\gcd(d(L(a_1f)),d(L(u_1v_0g)))\notin k$. As a result, the ideal $$\Big (\dfrac{\partial \zeta(y)}{\partial y}, \dfrac{\partial \zeta(y)}{\partial z} \Big) \triangleleft k[x,y,z]$$
is proper. So we have a contradiction.

\begin{ex}\label{ex1} 
{\em
Let us fix non-zero polynomials $r_1,r_2\in k[x]$ and $h_1,h_2\in k[x,t]$ such that

We consider $h_i=h_i(t)$ as a polynomial in one variable $t$ with coefficients in $k[x]$ and denote its formal derivative by $h_i'=h_i'(t)$.

Consider the following automorphisms from $\mathrm{T}_2(k(x))$:

Let us denote $\sigma=r_1(x)z-h_1(y)$.
Then we consider the composition 
$$\alpha=\theta\circ\beta_2\circ\theta\circ\beta_1\colon
\begin{pmatrix}
y\\
z

\rightarrow
\begin{pmatrix}

Set  $f:=r_2(x)y-h_2(\sigma)=r_2(x)y-h_2(r_1(x)z-h_1(y))$ and $g:=\sigma=r_1(x)z-h_1(y)$. 
Let $D$ be the corresponding $k[x]$-LND of $B$. 
According to this decomposition, we obtain a full MC-chain 
\begin{multline*}
\delta_1=\frac{\partial}{\partial y},\qquad \delta_2=\frac{\partial}{\partial z},\qquad \delta_3\colon

\begin{pmatrix}
h_2'(\sigma)r_1(x)\\
r_2(x)+h_2'(\sigma)h_1'(y)

So, $\mathrm{lev}_{(x,y,z)}D=4$ and one can write $D$ explicitly as
$$D=\Big{(}h_2'(r_1(x)z-h_1(y))r_1(x)\Big{)}\dfrac{\partial}{\partial y}+\Big{(}r_2(x)+h_2'(r_1(x)z-h_1(y))h_1'(y)\Big{)}\dfrac{\partial }{\partial z}.$$
 Let us prove that $\mathrm{ulev}\,D=4$, i.e. that $D$ is non-triangularizable. 
Take $p=1,q=0$. Then
$\overline{f}=\overline{h_2(h_1(y))}=a_1a_2y^{m_1m_2}$, $\overline{g}=\overline{h_1(y)}=a_1y^{m_1}$. Hence, $\deg \overline{f}>\deg \overline{g}$ and polynomials $\overline{f}$ and~$g$ are primitive. We have $L(f)=r_2(x)y$, $L(g)=r_1(x)z$. Therefore, 
$\gcd(d(L(f),d(L(g)))=r(x)\in k[x]\setminus k$. Also we have $g(x,0,0)=h_1(0)=0$. So, all conditions of Proposition~\ref{usnap} are satisfied. Hence, by Corollary~\ref{ustr}, $D$ is non-triangularizable.

\section{Rank $\mathbf{3}$ derivations}\label{rk3der}
In~\cite{F98}, Freudenburg introduced the following  example of a $\mathrm{rank}\,3$ derivation $\Delta$ of $B=k[x,y,z]$. Denote 
$$u=xz-y^2~~\text{and}~~ v=zu^2+2x^2yu+x^5.$$
Then $\Delta={\rm Jac}(u,v,\cdot).$
The proof that $\Delta$ has rank 3 is based on the fact that $\Delta$ is homogeneous with respect to the standard $\mathbb{Z}$-grading. Till now, all known rank $3$  derivations are $\mathbb{Z}$-homogeneous for suitable $\mathbb{Z}$-gradings.  In this section we give a new proof of the fact that $\Delta$ has rank 3. This proof does not use homogeneity of $\Delta$. This approach allows us to give new examples of rank $3$ LNDs, which are not homogeneous. In particular, we construct a family of rank $3$ LNDs, of which $\Delta$ is a member.

\smallskip
\noindent
We begin with an elementary lemma.
\begin{lem}\label{rk3com1}
Let $B=k^{[3]}$, $D (\neq 0) \in {\rm LND}(B)$ and $A:={\rm Ker}~D$. Let $g$ be a local slice of $D$ and let $D(g)=f\ \in A$. Then $A[g]$ is $D$-invariant and the restriction of $D$ to $A[g]$ equals $f\dfrac{\partial }{\partial g}\in {\rm LND}(A[g])$. 
%Moreover, $D$ can be extended from $\delta$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof} Let $A=k[u,v](=k^{[2]})$. Let $\delta =f\dfrac{\partial }{\partial g}$. Then $\delta(u)=\delta(v)=0$ and $\delta(g)=f$. So $D\vert_{A[g]}=\delta \in {\rm LND}(A[g])$. Since $g$ is a local slice of $D$, we have $k[x,y,z,\frac{1}{f}]=k[u,v,\frac{1}{f}][g]$. So any element $s \in B$ can be represented as 
$$s=\dfrac{f_s(u,v,g)}{f^{m_s}},~\text{where}~f_s \in k[u,v,g]=A[g]~\text{and}~m_s \in \bN \cup \{0\}.$$
One can extend $\delta$ to $B$ by defining $\delta(s):=\dfrac{\delta(f_s)}{f^{m_s}}$. Then $$f^{m_s}{\delta}(s)=\delta(f_s(u,v,g))=f\dfrac{\partial f_s}{\partial g}=f^{m_s}D (s).$$ So $\delta=D$ in $B$.
%So for each $n \in \bN$, $f^{m_s}{\delta}^n (s)={\delta}^n(f_s(u,v,g))=$. Thus $\delta \in {\rm LND}(B)$. 
\end{proof}

\smallskip
\noindent
\begin{rem}\label{nepsam}
{\em In notations as above, $D$ admits a non-equivalent LND $E$ of $B$ commuting with $D$ if and only if $\delta=D|_{A[g]}$ admits a non-equivalent LND $\xi$ of $A[g]$.
Indeed, $f$ generates both plinth ideals $\mathrm{pl}(D)$ and  $\mathrm{pl}(\delta)$. Then Lemma~\ref{rk2com1} implies the goal.
}
\end{rem}

\smallskip
\noindent
Thus we have the following result.
\begin{prop}\label{rk3com2}
Let $B=k^{[3]}$, $D (\neq 0) \in {\rm LND}(B)$ be of rank $3$ and $A:={\rm Ker}~D$. Then~if $g$ is any minimal local slice of $D$, then $D(g)$ cannot be written as an univariate polynomial in any variable of $A$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}Suppose not. Then there exists $x \in A$ such that $A=k[x]^{[1]}$ and $D(g) \in k[x]$. By Lemma \ref{dtriang} (ii), $x$ is a variable in $B$ and since $\rm{rk}~D=3$, we have a contradiction. 
\end{proof}

Lemma~\ref{rk3com1} and Proposition~\ref{rk3com2} imply that $D$ is an extension of rank 1 derivation $f\frac{\partial}{\partial g}$ on $A[g]$, where $f=D(g)\in A$ cannot be written as an univariate polynomial in any variable of~$A$. Note that similar extension we obtain considering any slice $h$ of $D$. Indeed, since $D(h)$ is divisible by $f=D(g)$, it cannot be written as an univariate polynomial in any variable of~$A$. 
If $D$ is irreducible, the converse of Proposition \ref{rk3com2} is true. So we obtain the following statement.
\begin{prop}\label{rrr} Let $B=k^{[3]}$ and $D$ be an irreducible LND of $B$. Put $A=\mathrm{Ker}\,D$. Let $g$ be a minimal local slice of $D$. Suppose $D(g)$ cannot be written as an univariate polynomial in any variable of $A$. Then $\mathrm{rk}\,D=3$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof} Assume that $D$ is irreducible of rank at most $2$, by Lemma \ref{rk2lem}, there exists $\tilde{g} \in B$ and a variable $x$ of $B$ in $A$ such that $D(\tilde{g}) \in k[x]$. Let $g$ be any minimal local slice of $D$. Then $D(g) \mid D(\tilde{g})$. Hence $D(g)$ is a univariate polynomial in $x$, which by Lemma \ref{dtriang} (i) is also a variable in $A$.
\end{proof}


Using the assertions above we obtain the following criterion for an irreducible derivation $D$ of $k^{[3]}$ to be an LND of rank 3. 


\begin{thm}\label{usrt}
Let $B=k^{[3]}$ and $D$ be an irreducible derivation of $B$. Then $D$ is an LND of rank 3 if and only if there are polynomials $u,v,w\in B$ such that 
\begin{enumerate}
\item [\rm (i)] $\mathrm{Ker}\,D=k[u,v]$;

\item [\rm (ii)] $D(w)=f(u,v)$, where $f(u,v)\in k[u,v]$ is not an univariate polynomial in $k[u,v]$;

\item [\rm (iii)] there are no such $g,h,l\in k[u,v]$ and $s\in B$, that $w-g=sh$, $f=hl$, and  $h\notin k$;

\item [\rm (iv)] $x,y,z\in k[u,v,w,\frac{1}{f}]$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
Suppose that the conditions (i)-(iv) hold. Then $D$ is an LND. Indeed, $D(u)=D(v)=D(f)=0$ and $D(w)\in k[u,v]$. So $D$ is locally nilpotent on $k[x,y,z,\frac{1}{f}]=k[u,v,w,\frac{1}{f}]\supseteq B$. Hence, $D$ is an LND of $B$.
Let $A=\mathrm{Ker}\,D= k[u,v]$ and $l\in A$ be the generator of the plinth ideal $\mathrm{pl}(D)$. Then there exists $s\in B$, that $D(s)=l$. Since $f\in \mathrm{pl}(D)=(l)$, there exists $h\in A$, such that $f=hl$. Therefore, $D(w-sh)=f-lh=0$. So, $w-sh=g\in A$. By (iii), $h\in k^*$. Hence, $l=\dfrac{f}{h}$ is not a univariate polynomial. So there is no univariate polynomial in $\mathrm{pl}(D)=A \cap {\rm Im}~D$. By Proposition~\ref{rrr}, $\mathrm{rk}\,D=3$.


Conversely, suppose $D$ is locally nilpotent and $\mathrm{rk}\, D=3$. Then there exist $u,v,w, f \in B$ such that $A=\mathrm{Ker}\,D=k[u,v]$, $\mathrm{pl}(D)=(f)$, and $D(w)=f$. By Proposition~\ref{rk3com2}, $f$ is not univariate. If there exist $g,h,l\in k[u,v]$ and $s\in B$, such that $w-g=sh$, $f=hl$ and  $h\notin k$, then $D(s)=D\left(\frac{w-g}{h}\right)=l\notin (f)$. This contradicts that $l \in \mathrm{pl}(D)=(f)$.  By Proposition~\ref{proplocsl},  $x,y,z\in k[u,v,w,\frac{1}{f}]$. 
\end{proof}

\medskip
\indent
Now, let us introduce a family of derivations. Let us fix integer numbers $m\geqslant 2$, $n\geqslant 1$ and a polynomial $F\in k[t_1,t_2]$ such that $F(t_1,0) \notin k$.  Consider the polynomials 
$$
u=xz-y^m~~\text{and}~~ w=xF(x,u)+yu^n\in k[x,y,z].
$$
Denote 
$$
v=\frac{u^{mn+1}+w^m}{x}\in k[x,x^{-1},y,z].
$$
It is easy to see that $v \in k[x,y,z]$. Indeed, 
\begin{multline*}
v=\frac{u^{mn+1}+w^m}{x}=\frac{u^{mn}(xz-y^m)+(xF(x,u)+yu^n)^m}{x}=\\
u^{nm}z+x^{m-1}F^{m}(x,u)+mx^{m-2}F^{m-1}(x,u)yu^n+\ldots+mF(x,u)y^{m-1}u^{mn-n}\in k[x,y,z].
\end{multline*}
Now, let us denote 
$$
D(m,n,F)={\rm Jac}(u,v,\cdot).
$$
Then $D(2,1,t_1^2)=\Delta$. Indeed, in this case $u=xz-y^2$, $w=x^3+yu$, 
$v=\frac{u^3+w^2}{x}=u^2z+x(x^2)^2+2x^2yu=zu^2+2x^2yu+x^5$. So, $\{D(m,n,F)\}$ is a family of derivations containing $\Delta$. It is interesting to note that the only homogeneous derivations with respect to standard $\mathbb{Z}$-grading among $D(m,n,F)$ are $D(2,n,S(t_1^2, t_2))$, where $S$ is a homogeneous polynomial in two variables of degree $n$.

\begin{thm}\label{rk3final}
Let $B=k[x,y,z]$. For each $m\geqslant 2$, $n\geqslant 1$ and $F\in k[t_1,t_2]$ such that $F(t_1,0)\notin k$, the derivation $D=D(m,n,F)$ is an LND of $B$ with ${\rm rk}~D=3$.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
Let us check that all conditions of Theorem~\ref{usrt} are satisfied. We have 
$D(u)={\rm Jac}(u,v,u)=0$, $D(v)={\rm Jac}(u,v,v)=0$. So $\mathrm{Ker}\,D\supseteq k[u,v]$. 

\smallskip
\noindent
{\it Condition ${\rm (ii)}$.} $D(w)={\rm Jac}(u,v,w)$ by definition of $D$. Let us note that
$$
{\rm Jac}(u,xv,w)={\rm Jac}(u, u^{mn+1}+w^m, w)=0.
$$
But 
$$
{\rm Jac}(u,xv,w)=x{\rm Jac}(u,v,w)+v{\rm Jac}(u,x,w).
$$
So, we have 
\begin{multline*}
{\rm Jac}(u,v,w)=-\frac{v}{x}{\rm Jac}(u,x,w)=-\frac{v}{x}{\rm Jac}(u,x,xF(x,u)+yu^n)=\\
=-\frac{v}{x}{\rm Jac}(u,x,xF(x,u))-\frac{v}{x}{\rm Jac}(u,x,yu^n)=-\frac{v}{x}{\rm Jac}(u,x,yu^n)=\\
=-\frac{vu^n}{x}{\rm Jac}(u,x,y)=-\frac{vu^n}{x}{\rm Jac}(xz-y^m,x,y)=\\
=-\frac{vu^n}{x}{\rm Jac}(xz,x,y)=-u^nv{\rm Jac}(z,x,y)=-u^nv.
\end{multline*}
The polynomial $f=-u^nv$ is a product of two algebraically independent elements, so it is not univariate in $\mathrm{Ker}\,D$.

\smallskip
\noindent
{\it Condition ${\rm (iv)}$.} Since $v=\frac{u^{mn+1}+w^m}{x}$, we have 
$$x=\frac{u^{mn+1}+w^m}{v}=\frac{u^n(u^{mn+1}+w^m)}{u^nv}\in k\left[u,v,w,\frac{1}{f}\right].$$
Since $w=xF(x,u)+yu^n$, we have
$$
y=\frac{w-xF(x,u)}{u^n}=\frac{v(w-xF(x,u))}{u^nv}\in k\left[x,u,v,w,\frac{1}{f}\right]= k\left[u,v,w,\frac{1}{f}\right].
$$

\noindent
Moreover, since
$$
v=u^{mn}z+x^{m-1}F^{m}(x,u)+mx^{m-2}F^{m-1}(x,u)yu^n+\ldots+mF(x,u)y^{m-1}u^{mn-n},
$$
we have
\begin{multline*}
z=\frac{v-x^{m-1}F^{m}(x,u)-mx^{m-2}F^{m-1}(x,u)yu^n-\ldots-mF(x,u)y^{m-1}u^{nm-n}}{u^{mn}}=\\
=\frac{v^m(v-x^{m-1}F^{m}(x,u)-mx^{m-2}F^{m-1}(x,u)yu^n-\ldots-mF(x,u)y^{m-1}u^{mn-n})}{(vu^{n})^m}.
\end{multline*}
So, $z\in k\left[u,v,w,x,y,\frac{1}{f}\right]\subseteq k\left[u,v,w,\frac{1}{f}\right]$.

\smallskip
\noindent
{\it Condition ${\rm (i)}$.} Suppose $\mathrm{Ker}\,D\supsetneq k[u,v]$. The LND $D$ can be extended to the LND $\widetilde{D}$ of 
$$k\left[u,v,w,\frac{1}{f}\right]=k\left[u,v,w,\frac{1}{u^nv}\right].$$
We have $\mathrm{Ker}\, \widetilde{D}=k\left[u,v,\frac{1}{u^nv}\right].$ Therefore, $\mathrm{Ker}\, D=B\cap k\left[u,v,\frac{1}{u^nv}\right]$. 

\smallskip
\noindent
Let us prove that $(u)\cap k[v]=\{0\}$. Consider the natural embedding $\mathfrak{i}\colon k[v]\hookrightarrow B$ and the quotient homomorphism $\pi\colon B\rightarrow B/(u)$. Then $\mathrm{Ker}\,\pi\circ\mathfrak{i}=(u)\cap k[v]$. We have $\pi\circ\mathfrak{i}(v)=\pi(x^{m-1}F(x,0))$. If $\pi\circ\mathfrak{i}(h(v))=0$, then $\pi(h(x^{m-1}F(x,0)))=0$. Since $F(x,0)\notin k$, if $h\neq 0$, the polynomial $h(x^{m-1}F(x,0))$ is a non-zero polynomial in $x$. But $u \in k[x,y,z] \setminus k[x]$. So~$u$ cannot divide a non-zero polynomial in $x$. So, $(u)\cap k[v]=\{0\}$. Now let us prove that  $(v)\cap k[u]=\{0\}$. Let us consider the following grading on $k[x,y,z]$: $\deg x=-1$, $\deg z=1$, $\deg y=0$. Then $u$ is a homogeneous element of degree zero. Therefore, each polynomial in~$u$ is a homogeneous element of degree zero. But $v$ is not a homogeneous element with respect to this grading. Hence, $v$ does not divide any non-zero polynomial in $u$, i.e. $(v)\cap k[u]=\{0\}$.  

\medskip
\noindent
Now suppose $\alpha \in B\cap k\left[u,v,\frac{1}{u^nv}\right]$. Note that, $u$ is irreducible in $B$, being a linear polynomial in $x$ with mutually co-prime coefficients. Since $u \nmid v$ and $u,v$ are algebraically independent, there exist non-negative integers $n_1, n_2$ and $g(u,v) \in k[u,v]$ such that $\alpha=\frac{g(u,v)}{u^{n_1}v^{n_2}}$. If both $n_1$ and $n_2$ are chosen to be minimal, then such a representation of $\alpha$ is unique. If $n_1=n_2=0$, then $\alpha \in k[u,v]$. Let us assume $n_2$ to be positive. Let $g(u,v)=g_0(u)+g_1(u)v+\ldots +g_p(u)v^r,$ where $g_i(u) \in k[u]$ for each $i \in \{0,1,\dots ,r\}$. We have $\alpha u^{n_1}v^{n_2-1}=\frac{g}{v}\in B$. Hence, $\frac{g_0}{v}\in B$. This implies $g_0\in (v)\cap k[u]$. So $g_0=0$ and hence $v \mid g(u,v)$. This contradicts the minimality of $n_2$. So $n_2=0$. Similarly, we can show that $n_1=0$. This implies $B\cap k\left[u,v,\frac{1}{u^nv}\right]=k[u,v]$.


\medskip
\noindent
{\it Irreducibility of D.} ~~Now we are ready  to prove that $D$ is irreducible. Suppose that the image of $D$ is contained in a proper ideal $(a)$, where $a \in B$.  Since $D(w)=-u^nv$, we have $a\mid u^nv$. Now 
$$
D(y)=D\left(\frac{w-xF(x,u)}{u^n} \right)=-v+\frac{\partial (xF(x,u))}{\partial x}(mw^{m-1}).
$$


\noindent
Let us recall that $v=u^{mn}z+x^{m-1}F^{m}(x,u)+mx^{m-2}F^{m-1}(x,u)yu^n+\ldots+mF(x,u)y^{m-1}u^{mn-n}$. Therefore, $v-x^{m-1}F^{m}(x,0)$ is divisible by $u$. Also $w-xF(x,0)$  is divisible by $u$.
Hence, there exists $h\in B$ such that
\begin{multline*}
D(y)=-x^{m-1}F^{m}(x,0)+\frac{\partial (xF(x,0))}{\partial x}(mx^{m-1}F(x,0)^{m-1})+uh=\\
=(m-1)x^{m-1}F^{m}(x,0)+mx^mF(x,0)^{m-1}\frac{\partial (F(x,0))}{\partial x}+uh.
\end{multline*}
A polynomial in $x$ is divisible by $u$ if and only if it is zero. Let $\alpha x^k$  be the leading term of $F(x,0)$. Then the coefficient in 
$(m-1)x^{m-1}F^{m}(x,0)+mx^mF(x,0)^{m-1}\frac{\partial (F(x,0))}{\partial x}$ at $x^{mk+m-1}$ is equal to $(m-1)\alpha^m+mk\alpha^m=(mk+m-1)\alpha^m\neq 0$.
Therefore, $u\nmid D(y)$. It implies $u\nmid a$, and hence, $a\mid v$. Let us consider
$$
D(x)=D\left(\frac{u^{mn+1}+w^m}{v} \right)=\frac{mw^{m-1}(-u^nv)}{v}=-mw^{m-1}u^n.
$$
We obtain $a\mid w^{m-1}u^n$. Since $u$ is irreducible and $u\nmid a$, we have $a\mid w^{m-1}$. So, we have $a\mid v$ and $a\mid  w^{m-1}$. This implies $\gcd (v,w)\notin k^*$. Then 
$$\gcd(xv,w)=\gcd(u^{mn+1}+w^m,w)=\gcd(u^{mn+1},w) \notin k^*.$$ 
Therefore, $u\mid w$. But $w=xF(x,u)+yu^n$. If $u\mid w$, then $u\mid xF(x,0)$. But $F(x,0)\notin k$, hence $xF(x,0)$ is a non-zero polynomial in $x$. Since $u$ depends on $y$ and $z$, it cannot divide $xF(x,0)$. Thus we have a contradiction and hence  $D$ is irreducible. 



\smallskip
\noindent
{\it Condition ${\rm (iii)}$.} Assume there exist such $g,h,l\in k[u,v]$ and $s\in B$, that $w-g=sh$, $f=u^nv=hl$, and  $h\notin k$. 
Since $k[u,v]=\mathrm{Ker}\,D$ is factorially closed, $h\in k[u,v]$. So, $h=u^pv^q$, where $0\leq p\leq n$, $0\leq q\leq 1$. 
%Hence either $w-g$ is divisible either by $u$ or by~$v$. 
Suppose $q=0$. Then $u\mid (w-g)$ i.e. $u\mid (xF(x,u)+yu^n-g)$. Since $g\in k[u,v]$, we write $g=g(u,v)$. Then $u\mid (xF(x,0)-g(0,v))$. But 
\begin{multline*}
v=u^{mn}z+x^{m-1}F^{m}(x,u)+mx^{m-2}F^{m-1}(x,u)yu^n+\ldots+mF(x,u)y^{m-1}u^{mn-n}=\\
=x^{m-1}F^{m}(x,0)+ur, \text{ for some r}\in B.
\end{multline*}
So, we have $u\mid (xF(x,0)-G(x^{m-1}F^{m}(x,0))$ for some univariate polynomial $G$. But 
$$xF(x,0)-G(x^{m-1}F^{m}(x,0))$$ 
is a non-zero polynomial in $x$, because $m \geqslant 2$ and $F(x,0) \notin k$.
This is a contradiction as non-zero polynomial in $x$ cannot be divisible by~$u$.  Therefore, $w-g$ is not divisible by~$u$. So we can assume $q=1$. Then $v \mid (w-g)$ i.e. $v\mid (xF(x,u)+yu^n-g)$. Hence $v\mid (xF(x,u)+yu^n-g(u,0))$. Putting $y=z=0$,  we have $u(x,0,0)=0,~~v(x,0,0)=x^{m-1}F^{m}(x,0)~~\text{and}~~w(x,0,0)=xF(x,0)$. Then 
$$x^{m-1}F^m(x,0) \mid (xF(x,0)-g(0,x^{m-1}F^m(x,0))$$ which is again a contradiction as $m\geqslant 2$ and $F(x,0) \notin k$. So $w-g$ is not divisible by $v$. Hence $D$ is irreducible.

Thus, all conditions of Theorem~\ref{usrt} are satisfied. Therefore, $D(m,k,F)$ is an LND of rank 3. 
\end{proof}


So we see that Freudenburg's example can be considered as a member of a large family of rank $3$ LNDs on $k^{[3]}$.

Analogically, 
$$
v=u^{mn}z+x^{m-1}F^{m}(x,u)+mx^{m-2}F^{m-1}(x,u)yu^n+\ldots+mF(x,u)y^{m-1}u^{mn-n}
$$
is linear in $z$. So, if $v=v_1v_2$, then we can assume that $v_1$ does not depend on $z$. Therefore, $v_1\mid u^{mn}$. Since $u$ is irreducible, we can assume $v_1=u^{d}$ for some $d$. But since $v=v_1v_2$ and $v_1$ does not depend on $z$,  we have 
$$
v_1\mid x^{m-1}F^{m}(x,u)+mx^{m-2}F^{m-1}(x,u)yu^n+\ldots+mF(x,u)y^{m-1}u^{mn-n}. 
$$
If $d>0$, then we obtain $u\mid  x^{m-1}F^{m}(x,u)$. This contradicts to the condition $F(x,0)\neq const$. Hence, $d=0$ and $v_1=const$.


If $D$ is not irreducible, then all elements of its image are divisible either by $u$ or by $v$.
let us prove that $w$ is not divisible by $u$ and $v$. Indeed, $w=xF(x,u)+yu^n$. Since $F(x,0)$ is not a constant and $p(x)$ is not divisible by $u=xz-y^m$, $w$ is not divisible by $u$. Assume $v\mid w$. We have $v=\frac{u^{mn+1}+w^m}{x}$, hence $u^{mn+1}=xv-w^m$ is divisible by $v$. A contradiction. Therefore, $w$ is not divisible by~$v$.
We have 
$$
D(x)=D\left(\frac{u^{mn+1}+w^m}{v} \right)=\frac{mw^{m-1}(-u^nv)}{v}=-mw^{m-1}u^n.
$$
That is $v$ does not divide $D(x)$.

$$
D(y)=D\left(\frac{w-xF(x,u)}{u^n} \right)=-v+\frac{\partial (xF(x,u))}{\partial x}(mw^{m-1}u^n).
$$
This implies that $u$ does not divide $D(y)$. So, $D$ is irreducible.
