\paragraph{Classic approaches.}
% Numerous studies have been conducted on MIL even before the  ``deep learning era'' \footnote[1]{It is usually refered to 2012 when AlexNet achieved a significant improvement in image recognition accuracy over previous methods in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge}. 
% Numerous studies on MIL have been conducted even prior to the advent of deep learning. 
Examples of classic MIL methods includes iARP~\citep{dietterich1997solving}, 
Diverse Density~\citep{maron1997framework}, 
Citation-kNN~\citep{wang2000solving}, MI-Kernels~\citep{zhang2001dd}, MI/mi-SVM~\citep{andrews2002support}, mi-Graph ~\citep{zhou2009multi}, MILBoost~\citep{zhang2005multiple}, GPMIL~\citep{kim2010gaussian}, among others.
