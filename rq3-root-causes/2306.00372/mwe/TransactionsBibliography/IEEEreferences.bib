ABSTRACT = {Price arbitrage involves taking advantage of an electricity price difference, storing electricity during low-prices times, and selling it back to the grid during high-prices periods. This strategy can be exploited by customers in presence of dynamic pricing schemes, such as hourly electricity prices, where the customer electricity cost may vary at any hour of day, and power consumption can be managed in a more flexible and economical manner, taking advantage of the price differential. Instead of modifying their energy consumption, customers can install storage systems to reduce their electricity bill, shifting the energy consumption from on-peak to off-peak hours. This paper develops a detailed storage model linking together technical, economic and electricity market parameters. The proposed operating strategy aims to maximize the profit of the storage owner (electricity customer) under simplifying assumptions, by determining the optimal charge/discharge schedule. The model can be applied to several kinds of storages, although the simulations refer to three kinds of batteries: lead-acid, lithium-ion (Li-ion) and sodium-sulfur (NaS) batteries. Unlike literature reviews, often requiring an estimate of the end-user load profile, the proposed operation strategy is able to properly identify the battery-charging schedule, relying only on the hourly price profile, regardless of the specific facility’s consumption, thanks to some simplifying assumptions in the sizing and the operation of the battery. This could be particularly useful when the customer load profile cannot be scheduled with sufficient reliability, because of the uncertainty inherent in load forecasting. The motivation behind this research is that storage devices can help to lower the average electricity prices, increasing flexibility and fostering the integration of renewable sources into the power system.},

abstract = "Proper installation of rooftop photovoltaic generation in distribution networks can improve voltage profile, reduce energy losses, and enhance the reliability. But, on the other hand, some problems regarding harmonic distortion, voltage magnitude, reverse power flow, and energy losses can arise when photovoltaic penetration is increased in low voltage distribution network. Local battery energy storage system can mitigate these disadvantages and as a result, improve the system operation. For this purpose, battery energy storage system is charged when production of photovoltaic is more than consumers’ demands and discharged when consumers’ demands are increased. Since the price of battery energy storage system is high, economic, environmental, and technical objectives should be considered together for its placement and sizing. In this paper, optimal placement, sizing, and daily (24 h) charge/discharge of battery energy storage system are performed based on a cost function that includes energy arbitrage, environmental emission, energy losses, transmission access fee, as well as capital and maintenance costs of battery energy storage system. All simulations are carried out in DIgSILENT and MATLAB linked together. Results show that by using the proposed approach, overvoltage and energy losses are decreased, reverse power flow is prevented, environmental emission is reduced, and economic profit is maximized."

ABSTRACT = {Flexible distributed energy resources, such as energy storage systems (ESSs), are increasingly considered as means for mitigating challenges introduced by the integration of stochastic, variable distributed generation (DG). The optimal operation of a distribution system with ESS can be formulated as a multi-period optimal power flow (MPOPF) problem which involves scheduling of the charging/discharging of the ESS over an extended planning horizon, e.g., for day-ahead operational planning. Although such problems have been the subject of many works in recent years, these works very rarely consider uncertainties in DG, and almost never explicitly consider uncertainties beyond the current operational planning horizon. This article presents a framework of methods and models for accounting for uncertainties due to distributed wind and solar photovoltaic power generation beyond the planning horizon in an AC MPOPF model for distribution systems with ESS. The expected future value of energy stored at the end of the planning horizon is determined as a function of the stochastic DG resource variables and is explicitly included in the objective function. Results for a case study based on a real distribution system in Norway demonstrate the effectiveness of an operational strategy for ESS scheduling accounting for DG uncertainties. The case study compares the application of the framework to wind and solar power generation. Thus, this work also gives insight into how different approaches are appropriate for modeling DG uncertainty for these two forms of variable DG, due to their inherent differences in terms of variability and stochasticity.},

abstract = "In this article, a new business model comprising multiple stakeholders is proposed to develop a frame for future flexible retail energy market in community microgrids. The microgrid comprises multiple and different distributed energy resources (DERs) such as renewable generation units, battery energy storage systems (BESSs), and micro diesel engines (MDE), to minimize daily operational costs of the system. To solve the defined complex optimization model, some operational strategies are proposed and then genetic algorithm is adopted to determine the hourly optimal power dispatch. The case study shows that the proposed model minimizes the daily operating cost of the community system effectively."

abstract = {Summary The optimal integration of emerging distributed energy resources (DERs) such as energy storage systems and distributed generations (DGs) can improve the performance of distribution systems (DS) significantly. However, increased penetration of DGs may adversely affect the system performance under certain conditions in terms of increased energy losses, voltage violation, power mismatch, reverse power flow etc. The demand response (DR) is one of the operational technologies which may help overcome such issues related to increased DG penetration. In this paper, the role of DR is investigated to optimally accommodate multiple photovoltaics (PV) and battery energy storage systems (BESS) in DS. The problem is formulated as bilevel constrained optimization problem which has been solved using genetic algorithm (GA). The level 1 of optimization determines the optimal nodes and sizes of multiple BESS and PVs which are to be integrated in the system. Thereafter, dispatch of BESS in coordination with DR is optimized in the level 2 optimization. The simulation results highlight the effectiveness of DR in accommodating multiple PV and BESS in DS.},

	abstract = "In this paper, a new codification is proposed for various meta-heuristic techniques to solve the reconfiguration problem of distribution networks. The full potential of meta-heuristic algorithms can be exploited by their efficient codification using some engineering knowledge base. The distribution system reconfiguration problems are non-differentiable, mixed integer and highly complex combinatorial in nature. In addition, the radiality constraint typically increases the intricacy of the meta-heuristic evolutionary algorithms. The proposed codification is based upon the fundamentals of graph theory which not only restricts the search space but also avoids tedious mesh checks. The proposed codification is computationally efficient and guarantees to generate only feasible radial topologies all times. The proposed method has been tested on three different test distribution systems and the results are promising."
