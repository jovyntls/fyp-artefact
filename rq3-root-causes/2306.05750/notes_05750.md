### Overview

**Issue:** Compilation failure in 2020 only

**Triage:** Fixed bug

**Root cause:** Inserting newlines in footnotes using the "\\\\" macro in some environments.

### Details

Source snippet:
```latex
\title{Monte Carlo simulation for Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard model under change of measure}
\author{Takuji Arai\footnote{Corresponding author} \ \footnote{
Department of Economics, Keio University, 2-15-45 Mita, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 108-8345, Japan. \\ (arai@econ.keio.ac.jp)} \\

(y-imai@nishogakusha-u.ac.jp)}}
\maketitle
```

Minimal reproduction (fails to compile in TL2020, but works in TL2021 onwards):

```latex
\documentclass{article}

\begin{document}
\title{Title}
\author{Author\footnote{line1 \\ line2}}
\maketitle
\end{document}
```

See `mwe/` for the logs when run with TL2020 and TL2021.
Logs from TL2020:

```
! Argument of \@firstoftwo has an extra }.
<inserted text> 
                \par 
l.6 \maketitle
```

This is similar to the logs from the [reported LaTeX bug](https://github.com/latex3/latex2e/issues/548).
We believe it is the same root cause, i.e. the double backslash macro was not sufficiently robust in tabulars.
This conclusion is supported by the following snippet found in the logs of the TL2020 run:

```
! Use of \@xfootnotemark doesn't match its definition.
\@ifnextchar ... \reserved@d =#1\def \reserved@a {
                                                  #2}\def \reserved@b {#3}\f...
l.61 \maketitle
               
If you say, e.g., `\def\a1{...}', then you must always
put `1' after `\a', since control sequence names are
made up of letters only. The macro here has not been
followed by the required stuff, so I'm ignoring it.

! Use of \@argtabularcr doesn't match its definition.
\@ifnextchar ...eserved@d =#1\def \reserved@a {#2}
                                                  \def \reserved@b {#3}\futu...
l.61 \maketitle
```

The fix was reported in [LaTeX2e News Issue 33](https://www.latex-project.org/news/latex2e-news/ltnews33.pdf) as “Made \\\\ generally robust”
