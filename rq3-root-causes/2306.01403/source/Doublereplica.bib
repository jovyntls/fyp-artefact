  abstract = {Fitness landscapes are often described in terms of ‘peaks’ and ‘valleys’, indicating an intuitive low-dimensional landscape of the kind encountered in everyday experience. The space of genotypes, however, is extremely high dimensional, which results in counter-intuitive structural properties of genotype-phenotype maps. Here we show that these properties, such as the presence of pervasive neutral networks, make fitness landscapes navigable. For three biologically realistic genotype-phenotype map models—RNA secondary structure, protein tertiary structure and protein complexes—we find that, even under random fitness assignment, fitness maxima can be reached from almost any other phenotype without passing through fitness valleys. This in turn indicates that true fitness valleys are very rare. By considering evolutionary simulations between pairs of real examples of functional RNA sequences, we show that accessible paths are also likely to be used under evolutionary dynamics. Our findings have broad implications for the prediction of natural evolutionary outcomes and for directed evolution.}

journal = {Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment},
abstract = {Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is the workhorse algorithm of deep learning technology. At each step of the training phase, a mini batch of samples is drawn from the training dataset and the weights of the neural network are adjusted according to the performance on this specific subset of examples. The mini-batch sampling procedure introduces a stochastic dynamics to the gradient descent, with a non-trivial state-dependent noise. We characterize the stochasticity of SGD and a recently-introduced variant, persistent SGD, in a prototypical neural network model. In the under-parametrized regime, where the final training error is positive, the SGD dynamics reaches a stationary state and we define an effective temperature from the fluctuation–dissipation theorem, computed from dynamical mean-field theory. We use the effective temperature to quantify the magnitude of the SGD noise as a function of the problem parameters. In the over-parametrized regime, where the training error vanishes, we measure the noise magnitude of SGD by computing the average distance between two replicas of the system with the same initialization and two different realizations of SGD noise. We find that the two noise measures behave similarly as a function of the problem parameters. Moreover, we observe that noisier algorithms lead to wider decision boundaries of the corresponding constraint satisfaction problem.}

journal = {Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical},
abstract = {Both natural ecosystems and biochemical reaction networks involve populations of heterogeneous agents whose cooperative and competitive interactions lead to a rich dynamics of species’ abundances, albeit at vastly different scales. The maintenance of diversity in large ecosystems is a longstanding puzzle, towards which recent progress has been made by the derivation of dynamical mean-field theories of random models. In particular, it has recently been shown that these random models have a chaotic phase in which abundances display wild fluctuations. When modest spatial structure is included, these fluctuations are stabilized and diversity is maintained. If and how these phenomena have parallels in biochemical reaction networks is currently unknown. Making this connection is of interest since life requires cooperation among a large number of molecular species. In this work, we find a reaction network whose large-scale behavior recovers the random Lotka–Volterra model recently considered in theoretical ecology. We clarify the assumptions necessary to derive its large-scale description, and reveal the underlying assumptions made on the noise to recover previous dynamical mean-field theories. Then, we show how local detailed balance and the positivity of reaction rates, which are key physical requirements of chemical reaction networks, provide obstructions towards the construction of an associated dynamical mean-field theory of biochemical reaction networks. Finally, we outline prospects and challenges for the future.}

Remarkably, extensive fine-scale diversity can coexist spatially. How is this diversity stable on long timescales, despite selective or ecological differences and other evolutionary processes? Most work has focused on stable coexistence or assumed ecological neutrality. We present an alternative: extensive diversity maintained by ecologically driven spatiotemporal chaos, with no assumptions about niches or other specialist differences between strains. We study generalized Lotka–Volterra models with antisymmetric correlations in the interactions inspired by multiple pathogen strains infecting multiple host strains. Generally, these exhibit chaos with increasingly wild population fluctuations driving extinctions. But the simplest spatial structure, many identical islands with migration between them, stabilizes a diverse chaotic state. Some strains (subspecies) go globally extinct, but many persist for times exponentially long in the number of islands. All persistent strains have episodic local blooms to high abundance, crucial for their persistence as, for many, their average population growth rate is negative. Snapshots of the abundance distribution show a power law at intermediate abundances that is essentially indistinguishable from the neutral theory of ecology. But the dynamics of the large populations are much faster than birth–death fluctuations. We argue that this spatiotemporally chaotic “phase” should exist in a wide range of models, and that even in rapidly mixed systems, longer-lived spores could similarly stabilize a diverse chaotic phase.}}

This chapter focuses on solving the dynamics of recurrent neural networks using nonequilibrium statistical mechanical techniques. It introduces recurrent neural networks and their properties. The chapter starts with relatively simple networks, with a small number of attractors (such as systems with uniform synapses or with a small number of patterns stored with Hebbian-type rules), which can be solved with relatively simple mathematical techniques. The chapter shows how to solve the dynamics of fully connected as well as extremely diluted networks, emphasizing on the crucial issue of presence (or absence) of synaptic symmetry and compares the predictions of the (exact) generating functional formalism to both numerical simulations and simple approximate theories. Any finite degree of synaptic symmetry, whether in a fully connected or in an extremely diluted attractor network, immediately generates an effective retarded self-interaction in the dynamics that is responsible for highly nontrivial “glassy” dynamics.}

abstract = {Stochasticity in gene expression is manifested as fluctuations in the abundance of expressed molecules at the single-cell level, and variability and heterogeneity within populations of genetically identical cells.Analyses of simple models indicate that stochasticity in gene expression is dominated by translational bursting, arising from a low number of expressed mRNAs, and transcriptional bursting, arising from slow transitions between promoter states.Transcriptional bursting, which arises from random transitions between chromatin states, might cause stochastic all-or-nothing responses in eukaryotic cells and lead to the emergence of populations that contain a mixture of expressing and non-expressing cells.Experimental evidence indicates that translational bursting is a dominant source of stochasticity in prokaryote gene expression, and that both translational and transcriptional bursting contribute to stochasticity in eukaryote gene expression.Evidence also indicates that translational bursting in eukaryotes is an evolvable trait that is subject to natural selection. Transcriptional bursting has been implicated in syndromes that are associated with haploinsufficiency.Sources that are extrinsic to the process of gene expression, such as fluctuations in regulatory signals, also contribute significantly to stochasticity in gene expression. Gene-intrinsic and gene-extrinsic noise can be distinguished experimentally using a two-reporter assay.Fluctuations in regulatory signals are important for the function of transcriptional regulatory networks. In genetic cascades, such fluctuations lead to increased population variability at intermediate expression levels and an initial population asynchrony that increases with cascade length. Increased variability in a regulatory signal might also cause the emergence of mixed populations, containing cells that show either high or low expression levels of the target gene.Negative and positive feedback typically leads to reduction and amplification, respectively, of fluctuations and population heterogeneity. Positive feedback can yield unique or multiple cellular-expression states, depending on the strength of the feedback.Stochasticity in gene expression might provide microorganisms with the flexibility required to respond and adapt to environmental changes and stresses, and can prevent cells from being trapped in suboptimal epigenetic states and phenotypes.Stochastic mechanisms have also been implicated in cellular differentiation and development. They provide a means of generating the initial population heterogeneity on which regulatory mechanisms can function to establish and propagate the expression of cell-type-specific genes.}

title = {Stochastic switching in biology: from genotype to phenotype},
journal = {Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical},
abstract = {There has been a resurgence of interest in non-equilibrium stochastic processes in recent years, driven in part by the observation that the number of molecules (genes, mRNA, proteins) involved in gene expression are often of order 1–1000. This means that deterministic mass-action kinetics tends to break down, and one needs to take into account the discrete, stochastic nature of biochemical reactions. One of the major consequences of molecular noise is the occurrence of stochastic biological switching at both the genotypic and phenotypic levels. For example, individual gene regulatory networks can switch between graded and binary responses, exhibit translational/transcriptional bursting, and support metastability (noise-induced switching between states that are stable in the deterministic limit). If random switching persists at the phenotypic level then this can confer certain advantages to cell populations growing in a changing environment, as exemplified by bacterial persistence in response to antibiotics. Gene expression at the single-cell level can also be regulated by changes in cell density at the population level, a process known as quorum sensing. In contrast to noise-driven phenotypic switching, the switching mechanism in quorum sensing is stimulus-driven and thus noise tends to have a detrimental effect. A common approach to modeling stochastic gene expression is to assume a large but finite system and to approximate the discrete processes by continuous processes using a system-size expansion. However, there is a growing need to have some familiarity with the theory of stochastic processes that goes beyond the standard topics of chemical master equations, the system-size expansion, Langevin equations and the Fokker–Planck equation. Examples include stochastic hybrid systems (piecewise deterministic Markov processes), large deviations and the Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin (WKB) method, adiabatic reductions, and queuing/renewal theory. The major aim of this review is to provide a self-contained survey of these mathematical methods, mainly within the context of biological switching processes at both the genotypic and phenotypic levels. However, applications to other examples of biological switching are also discussed, including stochastic ion channels, diffusion in randomly switching environments, bacterial chemotaxis, and stochastic neural networks.}

    abstract = {Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) are complex systems in which many genes regulate mutually to adapt the cell state to environmental conditions. In addition to function, the GRNs possess several kinds of robustness. This robustness means that systems do not lose their functionality when exposed to disturbances such as mutations or noise, and is widely observed at many levels in living systems. Both function and robustness have been acquired through evolution. In this respect, GRNs utilized in living systems are rare among all possible GRNs. In this study, we explored the fitness landscape of GRNs and investigated how robustness emerged in highly-fit GRNs. We considered a toy model of GRNs with one input gene and one output gene. The difference in the expression level of the output gene between two input states, “on” and “off”, was considered as fitness. Thus, the determination of the fitness of a GRN was based on how sensitively it responded to the input. We employed the multicanonical Monte Carlo method, which can sample GRNs randomly in a wide range of fitness levels, and classified the GRNs according to their fitness. As a result, the following properties were found: (1) Highly-fit GRNs exhibited bistability for intermediate input between “on” and “off”. This means that such GRNs responded to two input states by using different fixed points of dynamics. This bistability emerges necessarily as fitness increases. (2) These highly-fit GRNs were robust against noise because of their bistability. In other words, noise robustness is a byproduct of high fitness. (3) GRNs that were robust against mutations were not extremely rare among the highly-fit GRNs. This implies that mutational robustness is readily acquired through the evolutionary process. These properties are universal irrespective of the evolutionary pathway, because the results do not rely on evolutionary simulation.},

abstract = {The variation in genetic sequences determining the binding of transcription factors is believed to be an important facet of evolution. However, the degree to which a genome is robust, that is, able to withstand changes and how robustness affects evolution is unclear. Payne and Wagner (p. 875) investigated the empirical support for mutational robustness by examining transcription factor (TF) binding in the mouse and yeast genomes. A network analysis of the degree of variation revealed that the sites with the highest affinity for TF binding exhibit the greatest tolerance for nucleotide substitutions, whereas low-affinity sites exhibit greater sensitivity to mutation. Thus, while mutational robustness and evolvability are antagonistic at the genotypic level, they are synergistic at the phenotypic level. Transcription factor binding sites form connected networks. Robustness, the maintenance of a character in the presence of genetic change, can help preserve adaptive traits but also may hinder evolvability, the ability to bring forth novel adaptations. We used genotype networks to analyze the binding site repertoires of 193 transcription factors from mice and yeast, providing empirical evidence that robustness and evolvability need not be conflicting properties. Network vertices represent binding sites where two sites are connected if they differ in a single nucleotide. We show that the binding sites of larger genotype networks are not only more robust, but the sequences adjacent to such networks can also bind more transcription factors, thus demonstrating that robustness can facilitate evolvability.}}

This region encodes an input-output function, referred to as signal-integration logic, that maps a specific combination of regulatory signals (inputs) to a particular expression state (output) of a gene. The space of all possible signal-integration functions is vast and the mapping from input to output is many-to-one: For the same set of inputs, many functions (genotypes) yield the same expression output (phenotype). Here, we exhaustively enumerate the set of signal-integration functions that yield identical gene expression patterns within a computational model of gene regulatory circuits. Our goal is to characterize the relationship between robustness and evolvability in the signal-integration space of regulatory circuits, and to understand how these properties vary between the genotypic and phenotypic scales. Among other results, we find that the distributions of genotypic robustness are skewed, so that the majority of signal-integration functions are robust to perturbation. We show that the connected set of genotypes that make up a given phenotype are constrained to specific regions of the space of all possible signal-integration functions, but that as the distance between genotypes increases, so does their capacity for unique innovations. In addition, we find that robust phenotypes are (i) evolvable, (ii) easily identified by random mutation, and (iii) mutationally biased toward other robust phenotypes. We explore the implications of these latter observations for mutation-based evolution by conducting random walks between randomly chosen source and target phenotypes. We demonstrate that the time required to identify the target phenotype is independent of the properties of the source phenotype.}",

    abstract = { Understanding the relationship between robustness and evolvability is key to understand how living things can withstand mutations, while producing ample variation that leads to evolutionary innovations. Mutational robustness and evolvability, a system's ability to produce heritable variation, harbour a paradoxical tension. On one hand, high robustness implies low production of heritable phenotypic variation. On the other hand, both experimental and computational analyses of neutral networks indicate that robustness enhances evolvability. I here resolve this tension using RNA genotypes and their secondary structure phenotypes as a study system. To resolve the tension, one must distinguish between robustness of a genotype and a phenotype. I confirm that genotype (sequence) robustness and evolvability share an antagonistic relationship. In stark contrast, phenotype (structure) robustness promotes structure evolvability. A consequence is that finite populations of sequences with a robust phenotype can access large amounts of phenotypic variation while spreading through a neutral network. Population-level processes and phenotypes rather than individual sequences are key to understand the relationship between robustness and evolvability. My observations may apply to other genetic systems where many connected genotypes produce the same phenotypes. }

  abstract = {The role of mutational robustness in evolution has been a topic of much debate and controversy. On the one hand, it would seem to impede adaptation by making it less easy for a new phenotype to develop in the event of environmental changes; on the other it is surely advantageous for an organism to buffer its phenotype against possibly unhelpful mutations. How can an organism handle this paradox, and be both robust and adaptable? A quantitative population genetics model gives a possible resolution to this problem, by showing that mutational robustness can either impede or facilitate adaptation, depending on the population size, the mutation rate and the structure of the fitness landscape.}

abstract = {SUMMARY Genotype–phenotype interactions during the evolution of form in multicellular organisms is a complex problem but one that can be aided by computational approaches. We present here a framework within which developmental patterns and their underlying genetic networks can be simulated. Gene networks were chosen to reflect realistic regulatory circuits, including positive and negative feedback control, and the exchange of a subset of gene products between cells, or within a syncytium. Some of these networks generate stable spatial patterns of a subset of their molecular constituents, and can be assigned to categories (e.g., “emergent” or “hierarchic”) based on the topology of molecular circuitry. These categories roughly correspond to what has been discussed in the literature as “self-organizing” and “programmed” processes of development. The capability of such networks to form patterns of repeating stripes was studied in network ensembles in which parameters of gene-gene interaction were caused to vary in a manner analogous to genetic mutation. The evolution under mutational change of individual representative networks of each category was also simulated. We have found that patterns with few stripes (≤3) are most likely to originate in the form of a hierarchic network, whereas those with greater numbers of stripes (≥4) originate most readily as emergent networks. However, regardless of how many stripes it contains, once a pattern is established, there appears to be an evolutionary tendency for emergent mechanisms to be replaced by hierarchic mechanisms. These results have potential significance for the understanding of genotype-phenotype relationships in the evolution of metazoan form.},

    abstract = {How can a microorganism adapt to a variety of environmental conditions despite the existence of a limited number of signal transduction mechanisms? We show that for any growing cells whose gene expression fluctuate stochastically, the adaptive cellular state is inevitably selected by noise, even without a specific signal transduction network for it. In general, changes in protein concentration in a cell are given by its synthesis minus dilution and degradation, both of which are proportional to the rate of cell growth. In an adaptive state with a higher growth speed, both terms are large and balanced. Under the presence of noise in gene expression, the adaptive state is less affected by stochasticity since both the synthesis and dilution terms are large, while for a nonadaptive state both the terms are smaller so that cells are easily kicked out of the original state by noise. Hence, escape time from a cellular state and the cellular growth rate are negatively correlated. This leads to a selection of adaptive states with higher growth rates, and model simulations confirm this selection to take place in general. The results suggest a general form of adaptation that has never been brought to light—a process that requires no specific mechanisms for sensory adaptation. The present scheme may help explain a wide range of cellular adaptive responses including the metabolic flux optimization for maximal cell growth.},

We outline how spatial geometry can be included, although this part of the model is not complete. As an example of the application of our results to a specific biological system, we show in detail how to derive a rigorously testable model of the network of segmentation genes operating in the blastoderm of Drosophila. To further illustrate our methods, we sketch how they could be applied to two other important developmental processes: cell cycle control and cell-cell induction.

    pages = {1--12},
    abstract = {Cells generally adapt to environmental changes by first exhibiting an immediate response and then gradually returning to their original state to achieve homeostasis. Although simple network motifs consisting of a few genes have been shown to exhibit such adaptive dynamics, they do not reflect the complexity of real cells, where the expression of a large number of genes activates or represses other genes, permitting adaptive behaviors. Here, we investigated the responses of gene regulatory networks containing many genes that have undergone numerical evolution to achieve high fitness due to the adaptive response of only a single target gene; this single target gene responds to changes in external inputs and later returns to basal levels. Despite setting a single target, most genes showed adaptive responses after evolution. Such adaptive dynamics were not due to common motifs within a few genes; even without such motifs, almost all genes showed adaptation, albeit sometimes partial adaptation, in the sense that expression levels did not always return to original levels. The genes split into two groups: genes in the first group exhibited an initial increase in expression and then returned to basal levels, while genes in the second group exhibited the opposite changes in expression. From this model, genes in the first group received positive input from other genes within the first group, but negative input from genes in the second group, and vice versa. Thus, the adaptation dynamics of genes from both groups were consolidated. This cooperative adaptive behavior was commonly observed if the number of genes involved was larger than the order of ten. These results have implications in the collective responses of gene expression networks in microarray measurements of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the significance to the biological homeostasis of systems with many components.},

An open question is to what extent transcriptional response to perturbations has been specifically selected along evolution. To test the possibility that transcriptional reprogramming does not need to be ‘pre-designed’ to lead to an adaptive metabolic state on physiological timescales, we confronted yeast cells with a novel challenge they had not previously encountered. We rewired the genome by recruiting an essential gene, HIS3, from the histidine biosynthesis pathway to a foreign regulatory system, the GAL network responsible for galactose utilization. Switching medium to glucose in a chemostat caused repression of the essential gene and presented the cells with a severe challenge to which they adapted over approximately 10 generations. Using genome-wide expression arrays, we show here that a global transcriptional reprogramming (>1200 genes) underlies the adaptation. A large fraction of the responding genes is nonreproducible in repeated experiments. These results show that a nonspecific transcriptional response reflecting the natural plasticity of the regulatory network supports adaptation of cells to novel challenges.},

Non-adiabatic regulation via slow binding/unbinding to the gene can be important in these cell fate decision-making processes. Based on a stem cell core gene network, we uncovered the stem cell developmental landscape. As the binding/unbinding speed decreases, the landscape topography changes from bistable attractors of stem and differentiated states to more attractors of stem and other different cell states as well as substates. Non-adiabaticity leads to more differentiated cell types and provides a natural explanation for the heterogeneity observed in the experiments. We quantified Waddington landscapes with two possible cell fate decision mechanisms by changing the regulation strength or regulation timescale (non-adiabaticity). Transition rates correlate with landscape topography through barrier heights between different states and quantitatively determine global stability. We found the optimal speeds of these cell fate decision-making processes. We quantified biological paths and predict that differentiation and reprogramming go through an intermediate state (IM1), whereas transdifferentiation goes through another intermediate state (IM2). Some predictions are confirmed by recent experimental studies. }

    abstract = {Embryonic stem cells exhibit pluripotency: they can differentiate into all types of somatic cells. Pluripotent genes such as Oct4 and Nanog are activated in the pluripotent state, and their expression decreases during cell differentiation. Inversely, expression of differentiation genes such as Gata6 and Gata4 is promoted during differentiation. The gene regulatory network controlling the expression of these genes has been described, and slower-scale epigenetic modifications have been uncovered. Although the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells is normally irreversible, reprogramming of cells can be experimentally manipulated to regain pluripotency via overexpression of certain genes. Despite these experimental advances, the dynamics and mechanisms of differentiation and reprogramming are not yet fully understood. Based on recent experimental findings, we constructed a simple gene regulatory network including pluripotent and differentiation genes, and we demonstrated the existence of pluripotent and differentiated states from the resultant dynamical-systems model. Two differentiation mechanisms, interaction-induced switching from an expression oscillatory state and noise-assisted transition between bistable stationary states, were tested in the model. The former was found to be relevant to the differentiation process. We also introduced variables representing epigenetic modifications, which controlled the threshold for gene expression. By assuming positive feedback between expression levels and the epigenetic variables, we observed differentiation in expression dynamics. Additionally, with numerical reprogramming experiments for differentiated cells, we showed that pluripotency was recovered in cells by imposing overexpression of two pluripotent genes and external factors to control expression of differentiation genes. Interestingly, these factors were consistent with the four Yamanaka factors, Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and Myc, which were necessary for the establishment of induced pluripotent stem cells. These results, based on a gene regulatory network and expression dynamics, contribute to our wider understanding of pluripotency, differentiation, and reprogramming of cells, and they provide a fresh viewpoint on robustness and control during development.},

However, such simple 1:1 mapping must now give place to the modern concepts of gene regulatory networks and gene expression noise. Both can, in the absence of genetic mutations, jointly generate a diversity of inheritable randomly occupied phenotypic states that could also serve as a substrate for natural selection. This form of epigenetic dynamics challenges Neo-Darwinism. It needs to incorporate the non-linear, stochastic dynamics of gene networks. A first step is to consider the mathematical correspondence between gene regulatory networks and Waddington's metaphoric ‘epigenetic landscape’, which actually represents the quasi-potential function of global network dynamics. It explains the coexistence of multiple stable phenotypes within one genotype. The landscape's topography with its attractors is shaped by evolution through mutational re-wiring of regulatory interactions – offering a link between genetic mutation and sudden, broad evolutionary changes.},

The self-reproducing species are here characterized by a set of binary traits, and they interact based on complementarity. In the case of an extensive number of traits we use path-integral techniques to demonstrate how the coupled dynamics of the system can be formulated in terms of an effective single-species process in the thermodynamic limit, and how persistent order parameters characterizing the stationary states may be computed from this process in agreement with existing replica studies of the statics. Numerical simulations confirm these results. The analysis of the dynamics allows an interpretation of two different types of phase transitions of the model in terms of memory onset at finite and diverging integrated response, respectively. We extend the analysis to the case of diluted couplings of an arbitrary symmetry, where replica theory is not applicable. Finally the dynamics, and in particular the approach to the stationary state of the model with a finite number of traits, are addressed.}

Another structural dataset of 5 families with identical sequences has been used for comparison. The RMSD computed after a global superimposition of the mutated protein on each native one is smaller than the RMSD calculated among proteins of identical sequences. The effect of the perturbation is very local, and not necessarily the highest at the position of the mutation. A RMSD between mutated and native proteins is computed over a 3-residue or a 7-residue window at each position. To separate the effects of structural fluctuations due to point mutations from other sources, pair RMSD have been translated into P values which themselves are included in a score called P-RANK. This score allows highlighting small backbone distortions by comparing these RMSD between mutated and native positions to the RMSD at the same positions in the absence of a mutation. It results from the P-RANK that 38$\%$ of all mutations produce a significant effect on the displacement. When compared with a random distribution of RMSD at un-mutated positions, we show that, even if the RMSD is greater when the mutation is in loops than in regular secondary structure, the relative effect is more important for regular secondary structures and for buried positions. We confirm the absence of correlation between RMSD and the predicted variation of free energy of folding but we found a small correlation between high RMSD and the error in the prediction of $\Delta \DeltaG$.},

    abstract = { Cancers are complex dynamic systems that undergo evolution and selection. Personalized medicine approaches in the clinic increasingly rely on predictions of tumour response to one or more therapies; these predictions are complicated by the inevitable evolution of the tumour. Despite enormous amounts of data on the mutational status of cancers and numerous therapies developed in recent decades to target these mutations, many of these treatments fail after a time due to the development of resistance in the tumour. The emergence of these resistant phenotypes is not easily predicted from genomic data, since the relationship between genotypes and phenotypes, termed the genotype–phenotype (GP) mapping, is neither injective nor functional. We present a review of models of this mapping within a generalized evolutionary framework that takes into account the relation between genotype, phenotype, environment and fitness. Different modelling approaches are described and compared, and many evolutionary results are shown to be conserved across studies despite using different underlying model systems. In addition, several areas for future work that remain understudied are identified, including plasticity and bet-hedging. The GP-mapping provides a pathway for understanding the potential routes of evolution taken by cancers, which will be necessary knowledge for improving personalized therapies. }

abstract = {Allostery commonly refers to the mechanism that regulates protein activity through the binding of a molecule at a different, usually distal, site from the orthosteric site. The omnipresence of allosteric regulation in nature and its potential for drug design and screening render the study of allostery invaluable. Nevertheless, challenges remain as few computational methods are available to effectively predict allosteric sites, identify signalling pathways involved in allostery, or to aid with the design of suitable molecules targeting such sites. Recently, bond-to-bond propensity analysis has been shown successful at identifying allosteric sites for a large and diverse group of proteins from knowledge of the orthosteric sites and its ligands alone by using network analysis applied to energy-weighted atomistic protein graphs. To address the identification of signalling pathways, we propose here a method to compute and score paths of optimised propensity that link the orthosteric site with the identified allosteric sites, and identifies crucial residues that contribute to those paths. We showcase the approach with three well-studied allosteric proteins: h-Ras, caspase-1, and 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1). Key residues in both orthosteric and allosteric sites were identified and showed agreement with experimental results, and pivotal signalling residues along the pathway were also revealed, thus providing alternative targets for drug design. By using the computed path scores, we were also able to differentiate the activity of different allosteric modulators.}

However, even though the slow evolution of the couplings allows some balancing between achieving unfrustrated spin configurations and adopting those favoured by the quenched disorder, it is seen that this is not generally sufficient to avoid replica-symmetry breaking throughout the frozen phases.

We draw phase diagrams taking into account the stability of solutions, and find that the temperature region in which the Hopfield attractor is stable increases as the learning coefficient increases. Theoretical results are confirmed by the direct numerical integration of the Langevin equation.

Redundancy seems to be widespread in genomes of higher organisms1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Examples of apparently redundant genes come from numerous studies of developmental biology10,11,12,13,14,15, immunology16,17, neurobiology18,19 and the cell cycle20,21. Yet there is a problem: genes encoding functional proteins must be under selection pressure. If a gene was truly redundant then it would not be protected against the accumulation of deleterious mutations. A widespread view is therefore that such redundancy cannot be evolutionarily stable. Here we develop a simple genetic model to analyse selection pressures acting on redundant genes. We present four cases that can explain why genetic redundancy is common. In three cases, redundancy is even evolutionarily stable. Our theory provides a framework for exploring the evolution of genetic organization.},

By simultaneously measuring the effects of thousands of combinations of mutations, these experiments have revealed that the genotype–phenotype relationship typically reflects not only genetic interactions between pairs of sites but also higher-order interactions among larger numbers of sites. However, modeling and understanding these higher-order interactions remains challenging. Here we present a method for reconstructing sequence-to-function mappings from partially observed data that can accommodate all orders of genetic interaction. The main idea is to make predictions for unobserved genotypes that match the type and extent of epistasis found in the observed data. This information on the type and extent of epistasis can be extracted by considering how phenotypic correlations change as a function of mutational distance, which is equivalent to estimating the fraction of phenotypic variance due to each order of genetic interaction (additive, pairwise, three-way, etc.). Using these estimated variance components, we then define an empirical Bayes prior that in expectation matches the observed pattern of epistasis and reconstruct the genotype–phenotype mapping by conducting Gaussian process regression under this prior. To demonstrate the power of this approach, we present an application to the antibody-binding domain GB1 and also provide a detailed exploration of a dataset consisting of high-throughput measurements for the splicing efficiency of human pre-mRNA 5′ splice sites, for which we also validate our model predictions via additional low-throughput experiments.}}

    abstract = {Phenotype of biological systems needs to be robust against mutation in order to sustain themselves between generations. On the other hand, phenotype of an individual also needs to be robust against fluctuations of both internal and external origins that are encountered during growth and development. Is there a relationship between these two types of robustness, one during a single generation and the other during evolution? Could stochasticity in gene expression have any relevance to the evolution of these types of robustness? Robustness can be defined by the sharpness of the distribution of phenotype; the variance of phenotype distribution due to genetic variation gives a measure of ‘genetic robustness’, while that of isogenic individuals gives a measure of ‘developmental robustness’. Through simulations of a simple stochastic gene expression network that undergoes mutation and selection, we show that in order for the network to acquire both types of robustness, the phenotypic variance induced by mutations must be smaller than that observed in an isogenic population. As the latter originates from noise in gene expression, this signifies that the genetic robustness evolves only when the noise strength in gene expression is larger than some threshold. In such a case, the two variances decrease throughout the evolutionary time course, indicating increase in robustness. The results reveal how noise that cells encounter during growth and development shapes networks' robustness to stochasticity in gene expression, which in turn shapes networks' robustness to mutation. The necessary condition for evolution of robustness, as well as the relationship between genetic and developmental robustness, is derived quantitatively through the variance of phenotypic fluctuations, which are directly measurable experimentally.},

With a simple model of a society, in which the dynamics of individual opinion formation is integrated with social balance, we show that these two phenomena might be tightly related. We identify a critical level of interconnectedness, above which society fragments into sub-communities that are internally cohesive and hostile towards other groups. This critical communication density necessarily exists in the presence of social balance, and arises from the underlying mathematical structure of a phase transition known from the theory of disordered magnets called spin glasses. We discuss the consequences of this phase transition for social fragmentation in society. },

This property—enetic (or mutational) robustness—is pervasive, and has important implications for disease and evolution, but is not well understood. Dating back to at least Waddington, it has been suggested that mutational robustness may be related to the requirement to withstand environmental or stochastic perturbations. Here I show that global quantitative data from yeast are largely consistent with this idea. Considering the effects of mutations in all nonessential genes shows that genes that confer robustness to environmental or stochastic change also buffer the effects of genetic change, and with similar efficacy. This means that selection during evolution for environmental or stochastic robustness (also referred to as canalization) may frequently have the side effect of increasing genetic robustness. A dynamic environment may therefore promote the evolution of phenotypic complexity. It also means that “hub” genes in genetic interaction (synthetic lethal) networks are generally genes that confer environmental resilience and phenotypic stability.},

An approach to overcoming this impediment is to reduce the space of possible models to take into account both types of robustness. However, the relationship between the two is still controversial. This work uncovers a network characteristic, transient responsiveness, for a specific function that correlates environmental imperturbability and genetic robustness. We test this characteristic extensively for dynamic networks of ordinary differential equations ranging up to 30 interacting nodes and find that there is a power-law relating environmental imperturbability and genetic robustness that tends to linearity as the number of nodes increases. Using our methods, we refine the classification of known 3-node motifs in terms of their environmental and genetic robustness. We demonstrate our approach by applying it to the chemotaxis signaling network. In particular, we investigate plausible models for the role of CheV protein in biochemical adaptation via a phosphorylation pathway, testing modifications that could improve the robustness of the system to environmental and/or genetic perturbation.},

    abstract = {Recurrent networks of non-linear units display a variety of dynamical regimes depending on the structure of their synaptic connectivity. A particularly remarkable phenomenon is the appearance of strongly fluctuating, chaotic activity in networks of deterministic, but randomly connected rate units. How this type of intrinsically generated fluctuations appears in more realistic networks of spiking neurons has been a long standing question. To ease the comparison between rate and spiking networks, recent works investigated the dynamical regimes of randomly-connected rate networks with segregated excitatory and inhibitory populations, and firing rates constrained to be positive. These works derived general dynamical mean field (DMF) equations describing the fluctuating dynamics, but solved these equations only in the case of purely inhibitory networks. Using a simplified excitatory-inhibitory architecture in which DMF equations are more easily tractable, here we show that the presence of excitation qualitatively modifies the fluctuating activity compared to purely inhibitory networks. In presence of excitation, intrinsically generated fluctuations induce a strong increase in mean firing rates, a phenomenon that is much weaker in purely inhibitory networks. Excitation moreover induces two different fluctuating regimes: for moderate overall coupling, recurrent inhibition is sufficient to stabilize fluctuations; for strong coupling, firing rates are stabilized solely by the upper bound imposed on activity, even if inhibition is stronger than excitation. These results extend to more general network architectures, and to rate networks receiving noisy inputs mimicking spiking activity. Finally, we show that signatures of the second dynamical regime appear in networks of integrate-and-fire neurons.},

abstract = {A general relationship between fluctuation and response in a biological system is presented. The fluctuation is given by the variance of some quantity, whereas the response is given as the average change of that quantity for a given parameter change. We propose a relationship where the two are proportional, in a similar way to the fluctuation–dissipation theorem in physics. By studying an evolution experiment where fluorescence of protein in bacteria increases, we confirm our relation by observing a positive correlation between the speed of fluorescence evolution and the phenotypic fluctuation of the fluorescence over clone bacteria. The generality of the relationship as well as its relevance to evolution is discussed.}}

abstract = {The relevance of phenotype fluctuations among clones (i.e., organisms with identical genes) to evolution has recently been recognized both theoretically and experimentally. By considering the stability of the distributions of genetic variations and phenotype fluctuations, we derive a general inequality between the phenotype variance due to genetic differences and the intrinsic phenotype variance of clones. For a given mutation rate, an approximately linear relationship between the two is obtained which elucidates the consistency between the fundamental theorem of natural selection by Fisher and the evolutionary fluctuation–response relationship (fluctuation dissipation theorem) proposed recently. A general condition for the error catastrophe is also derived as the violation of the inequality, which sets up the limit to the speed of stable evolution. All of these theoretical results are confirmed by a numerical evolution experiment of a cell that consists of a catalytic reaction network. Based on the relationships proposed here, relevance of the phenotypic plasticity to evolution as well as the genetic assimilation is discussed.}

    abstract = {The topology of cellular circuits (the who-interacts-with-whom) is key to understand their robustness to both mutations and noise. The reason is that many biochemical parameters driving circuit behavior vary extensively and are thus not fine-tuned. Existing work in this area asks to what extent the function of any one given circuit is robust. But is high robustness truly remarkable, or would it be expected for many circuits of similar topology? And how can high robustness come about through gradual Darwinian evolution that changes circuit topology gradually, one interaction at a time? We here ask these questions for a model of transcriptional regulation networks, in which we explore millions of different network topologies. Robustness to mutations and noise are correlated in these networks. They show a skewed distribution, with a very small number of networks being vastly more robust than the rest. All networks that attain a given gene expression state can be organized into a graph whose nodes are networks that differ in their topology. Remarkably, this graph is connected and can be easily traversed by gradual changes of network topologies. Thus, robustness is an evolvable property. This connectedness and evolvability of robust networks may be a general organizational principle of biological networks. In addition, it exists also for RNA and protein structures, and may thus be a general organizational principle of all biological systems.},

We consider a model consisting of protocells. Each protocell contains two mutually catalysing molecule species (X and Y), each of which has catalytically active and inactive types. One of the species Y is assumed to have a slower synthesis speed. Through divisions of the protocells, the system reaches and remains in a state in which there are only a few active Y and almost no inactive Y molecules in most protocells, through the selection of very rare fluctuations. In this state, the active Y molecules are shown to control the behavior of the protocell. The minority molecule species act as the carrier of heredity, due to the relatively discrete nature of its population, in comparison with the majority species which behaves statistically in accordance with the law of large numbers. The minority controlled state may give rise to a selection pressure for mechanisms that ensure the transmission of the minority molecule. Once those mechanisms are in place, the minority molecule becomes the ideal storage device for information to be transmitted across generations, thus giving rise to “genetic information”. The relevance of this minority controlled state to evolvability is also discussed.}

abstract = {Summary To unveil the logic of cell from a level of chemical reaction dynamics, we need to clarify how ensemble of chemicals can autonomously produce the set of chemical, without assuming a specific external control mechanism. A cell consists of a huge number of chemical species that catalyze each other. Often the number of each molecule species is not so large, and accordingly the number fluctuations in each molecule species can be large. In the amidst of such diversity and large fluctuations, how can a cell make recursive production? On the other hand, a cell can change its state to evolve to a different type over a longer time span. How are reproduction and evolution compatible? We address these questions, based on several model studies with catalytic reaction network. In the present survey paper, we first formulate basic questions on the recursiveness and evolvability of a cell, and then state the standpoint of our research to answer the questions, that is termed as 'constructive biology'. Based on this standpoint, we present general strategy of modeling a cell as a chemical reaction network. At the first part we investigate of the origin of heredity in a cell, by noting that the molecules carrying heredity must be preserved well and control the behavior of a cell. We take a simple model consisting of two mutually catalyzing molecule species, each of which has catalytically active and inactive types. One of the molecule species is synthesized slowly, and thus is a minority in population. Through the growth and division of this cell, it is shown to reach and remain in a state in which a active, minority molecules are preserved over generations, and control the cell behavior. This minority controlled state is achieved by preserving rare number fluctuations of molecules. The state gives rise to a selection pressure for mechanisms that ensure the transmission of the minority molecule. The minority molecule, thus, carries heredity, and is a candidate for “genetic information”. Experimental confirmation of this minority control is also presented. Next, a protocell model consisting of a large number mutually catalyzing molecule species is studied, in order to investigate how chemical compositions are transferred recursively under replication errors. Depending on the numbers of molecules and species in a cell, and the path rate in the reaction network, three phases are found: fast switching state without recursive production, recursive production, and itinerancy between the above two states. At a recursive production state chemicals are found to form intermingled hypercycle network that consists of core hypercycle and peripheral network that influence each other. How this intermingled network supports the recursive production, and how minority in the core hypercycle gives rise to a switch to other recursive states at the itinerancy phase are elucidated. Evolution of this hypercycle network is also studied, to show the approach to recursive production of cells and switch to more efficient reproduction states. Finally, statistics of the number distributions of each molecule species are studied, to show (i)power-law distribution of fast switching molecules (ii) suppression of fluctuation in the core-network molecule species and (iii) ubiquity of log-normal distribution for most other molecule species. The origin of these statistics are discussed, while suppression of the number fluctuations of a minority molecule that has high catalytic connections with others is clarified, that reinforces the minority control in the replication network.}

While replica analyses of such models are limited to systems with symmetric couplings, dynamical approaches as presented here allow us specifically to address cases with asymmetric interactions where there is no Lyapunov function governing the dynamics. We focus on replicator models with Gaussian couplings of general symmetry between p ⩾ 2 species, and discuss how an effective description of the dynamics can be derived in terms of a single-species process. Upon making a fixed point ansatz persistent order parameters in the ergodic stationary states can be extracted from this process, and different types of phase transitions can be identified and related to each other. We discuss the effects of asymmetry in the couplings on the order parameters and the phase behaviour for p = 2 and p = 3. Numerical simulations verify our theory. For the case of cubic interactions, numerical experiments indicate regimes in which only a finite number of species survives, even when the thermodynamic limit is considered.}

However, our empirical knowledge of these networks is typically incomplete and the space of simulation models and parameters is vast, leaving room for uncertainty in theoretical predictions. Here we show that a large fraction of this space of possibilities exhibits generic behaviors that are robust to modeling choices. We consider a wide array of model features, including interaction types and community structures, known to generate different dynamics for a few species. We combine these features in large simulated communities, and show that equilibrium diversity, functioning, and stability can be predicted analytically using a random model parameterized by a few statistical properties of the community. We give an ecological interpretation of this “disordered” limit where structure fails to emerge from complexity. We also demonstrate that some well-studied interaction patterns remain relevant in large ecosystems, but their impact can be encapsulated in a minimal number of additional parameters. Our approach provides a powerful framework for predicting the outcomes of ecosystem assembly and quantifying the added value of more detailed models and measurements.}}

Reciprocal interactions between ecology and evolution, eco-evolutionary feedbacks, are less well studied, even though they may be critical for understanding the evolution of biological diversity, the structure of communities and the function of ecosystems. Eco-evolutionary feedbacks require that populations alter their environment (niche construction) and that those changes in the environment feed back to influence the subsequent evolution of the population. There is strong evidence that organisms influence their environment through predation, nutrient excretion and habitat modification, and that populations evolve in response to changes in their environment at time-scales congruent with ecological change (contemporary evolution). Here, we outline how the niche construction and contemporary evolution interact to alter the direction of evolution and the structure and function of communities and ecosystems. We then present five empirical systems that highlight important characteristics of eco-evolutionary feedbacks: rotifer–algae chemostats; alewife–zooplankton interactions in lakes; guppy life-history evolution and nutrient cycling in streams; avian seed predators and plants; and tree leaf chemistry and soil processes. The alewife–zooplankton system provides the most complete evidence for eco-evolutionary feedbacks, but other systems highlight the potential for eco-evolutionary feedbacks in a wide variety of natural systems. }

    abstract = { Most species belong to ecological communities where their interactions give rise to emergent community-level properties, such as diversity and productivity. Understanding and predicting how these properties change over time has been a major goal in ecology, with important practical implications for sustainability and human health. Less attention has been paid to the fact that community-level properties can also change because member species evolve. Yet, our ability to predict long-term eco-evolutionary dynamics hinges on how repeatably community-level properties change as a result of species evolution. Here, we review studies of evolution of both natural and experimental communities and make the case that community-level properties at least sometimes evolve repeatably. We discuss challenges faced in investigations of evolutionary repeatability. In particular, only a handful of studies enable us to quantify repeatability. We argue that quantifying repeatability at the community level is critical for approaching what we see as three major open questions in the field: (i) Is the observed degree of repeatability surprising? (ii) How is evolutionary repeatability at the community level related to repeatability at the level of traits of member species? (iii) What factors affect repeatability? We outline some theoretical and empirical approaches to addressing these questions. Advances in these directions will not only enrich our basic understanding of evolution and ecology but will also help us predict eco-evolutionary dynamics.

pages = {242--283},
abstract = {Abstract RNA folding from sequences into secondary structures is a simple yet powerful, biophysically grounded model of a genotype–phenotype map in which concepts like plasticity, evolvability, epistasis, and modularity can not only be precisely defined and statistically measured but also reveal simultaneous and profoundly non-independent effects of natural selection. Molecular plasticity is viewed here as the capacity of an RNA sequence to assume a variety of energetically favorable shapes by equilibrating among them at constant temperature. Through simulations based on experimental designs, we study the dynamics of a population of RNA molecules that evolve toward a predefined target shape in a constant environment. Each shape in the plastic repertoire of a sequence contributes to the overall fitness of the sequence in proportion to the time the sequence spends in that shape. Plasticity is costly, since the more shapes a sequence can assume, the less time it spends in any one of them. Unsurprisingly, selection leads to a reduction of plasticity (environmental canalization). The most striking observation, however, is the simultaneous slow-down and eventual halting of the evolutionary process. The reduction of plasticity entails genetic canalization, that is, a dramatic loss of variability (and hence a loss of evolvability) to the point of lock-in. The causal bridge between environmental canalization and genetic canalization is provided by a correlation between the set of shapes in the plastic repertoire of a sequence and the set of dominant (minimum free energy) shapes in its genetic neighborhood. This statistical property of the RNA genotype–phenotype map, which we call plastogenetic congruence, traps populations in regions where most genetic variation is phenotypically neutral. We call this phenomenon neutral confinement. Analytical models of neutral confinement, made tractable by the assumption of perfect plastogenetic congruence, formally connect mutation rate, the topography of phenotype space, and evolvability. These models identify three mutational regimes: that corresponding to neutral confinement, an exploration threshold corresponding to a breakdown of neutral confinement with the simultaneous persistence of the dominant phenotype, and a classic error threshold corresponding to the loss of the dominant phenotype. In a final step, we analyze the structural properties of canalized phenotypes. The reduction of plasticity leads to extreme modularity, which we analyze from several perspectives: thermophysical (melting—the RNA version of a norm of reaction), kinetic (folding pathways—the RNA version of development), and genetic (transposability—the insensitivity to genetic context). The model thereby suggests a possible evolutionary origin of modularity as a side effect of environmental canalization.},

These qualities have started to be comprehended in full only since the application of network theory formalisms to regulatory phenomena. This review addresses the distinct role of network architecture (topology, logic) and biochemical/kinetic parameters in the materialization of various archetypical robust gene expression circuits in prokaryotes.

We demonstrate that sensitivity of gene expression to mutations increases with both increasing trans-mutational target size and the presence of a TATA box. Genes with greater sensitivity to mutations are also more sensitive to systematic environmental perturbations and stochastic noise. These results provide a mechanistic basis for gene expression evolvability that can serve as a foundation for realistic models of regulatory evolution.}}

abstract = {In cellular regulatory networks, genetic activity is controlled by molecular signals that determine when and how often a given gene is transcribed. In genetically controlled pathways, the protein product encoded by one gene often regulates expression of other genes. The time delay, after activation of the first promoter, to reach an effective level to control the next promoter depends on the rate of protein accumulation. We have analyzed the chemical reactions controlling transcript initiation and translation termination in a single such “genetically coupled” link as a precursor to modeling networks constructed from many such links. Simulation of the processes of gene expression shows that proteins are produced from an activated promoter in short bursts of variable numbers of proteins that occur at random time intervals. As a result, there can be large differences in the time between successive events in regulatory cascades across a cell population. In addition, the random pattern of expression of competitive effectors can produce probabilistic outcomes in switching mechanisms that select between alternative regulatory paths. The result can be a partitioning of the cell population into different phenotypes as the cells follow different paths. There are numerous unexplained examples of phenotypic variations in isogenic populations of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells that may be the result of these stochastic gene expression mechanisms.}}
