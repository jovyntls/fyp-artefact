@FOOTNOTE{Note1,key="Note1",note=" The effective dynamics is expected to yield the same statistics as that of the original dynamics, in an analogous manner to what has been rigorously proven for spin glasses \cite {BenArous2006}."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note2,key="Note2",note="Note that $h_{kj}$ differs from the local field typically used in spin-models and neural networks, where for a spin (neuron) $i$ its local field is the sum over the states $\sigma _j$ of its neighbors $h_i = \DOTSB \sum@ \slimits@ _{j\protect \neq  i} J_{ij}\sigma _j$."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note3,key="Note3",note="Note that when all the interactions between target genes become positive, another rescaling applies for $J_{ij}^{(tt)}$, namely $ J_{ij}^{(tt)} \rightarrow J_{ij}^{(tt)}/N_t$, while for the couplings between target- and non-target genes $ J_{ij}^{(to)} \rightarrow J_{ij}^{(to)}/\protect \sqrt  {N_t}$."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note4,key="Note4",note="If we consider a sequential dynamics for the couplings then the first two equations are $ d\protect \mathbf  {Y}(\tau )/d\tau = - \protect \mathbf  {Y}(\tau ) + {\protect \rm  tanh} \protect \big  (\protect \mathbf  {H}(\tau )\protect \big  )$, where $\protect \mathbf  {Y} = (\protect \hat  {w}, \protect \hat  {\lambda })$ and $\protect \mathbf  {H}(\tau )$ is given by the same expressions as in \protect \eqref  {closed1}"}
@FOOTNOTE{Note5,key="Note5",note="This square-root form of the original Hebbian rule is due to the definition of fitness $\Psi $."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note6,key="Note6",note="Note that since our calculations are restricted to the mean values of $J^{(tt)}$ and $J^{(to)}$, they can not be used to study how similar the evolved genotypes are in the robust phase"}
@FOOTNOTE{Note7,key="Note7",note="In case where the system has a non-zero averaged activity $m >0$, as $t, \tau \rightarrow \infty $, $\chi \propto \chi _m := \DOTSB \sum@ \slimits@ _{\tau ' = 0}^\tau G_m(t,\tau ,\tau ')$, where $G_{m}(t, \tau , \tau ') := \partial \langle x(t, \tau ) \rangle \protect \big  /\partial \protect \hat  {\mu }(\tau ') $ is the response to mutation. Such proportionality between the two responses that implies a correlation between phenotypic changes due to genetic variation and those in response to environmental perturbations, as suggested by \cite {KanekoPloSOne2007,Sato2003,Kaneko2006,Ciliberti, Sakata2020, Pham2022, Tang2021, Landry, Silva-Rocha, Uchida}, does not exist if $m\simeq 0$."}
